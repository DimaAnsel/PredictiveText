# Predictive Text

This project implements a link-based tree to learn words as it reads them in order to predict what is being typed in the future. Additionally, the program can learn from reading files, such as the books, Wikipedia articles, or Reddit posts included in the doc folder. For a detailed description of how the program works, read the Final Report PDF in the doc folder.
