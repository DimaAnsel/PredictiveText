On Futurology
If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called "future(s)" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s).
One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

Which was already curable. He turned down the cure in favor of fruit and death.

[–]blindsight 451 points 13 days ago 
Yeah; he was diagnosed very early, since he had very thorough physicals done often (as do most higher ups in Fortune 500 companies). When it was caught, he had a very good survival rate going with traditional treatment.
But despite having access to the best doctors in the world, he instead decided to try a fruit cleanse diet, or something similarly silly.

[–]jace_looter 23 points 13 days ago 
He could've used the fruit cleanse as well. It was NOT a binary decision.

I honestly wonder how people idolise this moron sometimes...

[–]bostonian15 98 points 13 days ago 
They do the same with the Nazi monger Henry Ford. He had a Hitler's autographed picture in his office. While American troops were dying in combat in Italy his European factories were working for Hitler.

[–]TeleKenetek 45 points 13 days ago 
You have to remember that when Ford had this photgraph, Hitler was Time Man of the Year, not evil death camp Hitler we all know today. Jusy a little food for thought.

[–]kitten_anus 31 points 13 days ago 
Time man of the year is more about who makes the most news, not who Time thinks is a good person. Stalin and the Ayatollah Khomeini both won it was as well. Eventually Time stopped giving it to controversial figures because of the backlash.

[–]bostonian15 20 points 13 days ago 
You have to understand that by 1938, the year Hitler was declared Man of the Year by Time magazine, Hitler was already prosecuting Jews, that same year the Evian Conference happened, and that same year the infamous Munich Pact happened. Hitler was already a devilish figure. Also, Man of the Year did not mean Good Man of the year, Stalin got the accolade the next year. Prior to that Ford was already voicing his racism and vitriolic discourse against the jews. Actually in 1938 he received the top Nazi medal: The Grand Cross of the German Eagle. 2 years after the Olympic Games in Berlin when Hitler refused to salute Jesse Owens for his gold medal! Anybody with a brain knew in 1938 that Hitler was the evil.

[–]3am_but_fuck_it 8 points 13 days ago 
Wasn't the entire western world at the time fairly racist towards the jewish community? It was only with the details released about Nazi Germany that the tables began to turn, prior to that they were a disliked group. most would have been supportive of hitler cracking down on them until the horrible details were revealed.

[–]new_vr 5 points 13 days ago 
The Western world hated anyone different. Segregation of water fountains didn't end until 1964! This is appalling to think about, but it's reality.

[–]bostonian15 1 point 13 days ago 
Wait, so if the majority is racist, then being racist is okay? The guy wrote a damn racist book blaming them for everything! He was also at that time an public opinion leader with a great leverage among industrial America. Have you read Philip Roth's " The plot against America"? Read it.

Jew's aren't a separate race....

[–]AntiChr1st 3 points 13 days ago 
Can people stop with the Jesse Owens myth already, it's been thoroughly debunked.
The fact of the matter is that on the first day of the olympics Hitler met with only the German winners (not white, the germans), at which point he was told that he have to meet with all the winners or none of them (at which point Hitler chose none).
Owens got the exact same treatment by Hitler that all the other non german athletes, and he would infact comment on his time in Germany as one where he was given significantly less shit for his skincolour than he did in the US

[–]DebonaireSloth 3 points 13 days ago 
Hitler had a certain time to come to the stadium and a certain time to leave. It happened he had to leave before the victory ceremony after the 100 meters. But before he left I was on my way to a broadcast and passed near his box. He waved at me and I waved back. I think it was bad taste to criticize the 'man of the hour' in another country.

[–]Kittens4Brunch 3 points 13 days ago 
not evil death camp Hitler we all know today
Hitler's view towards the Jews was not a secret. That's part of the reason Ford admired him.

Henry Ford was a despicable person...yes.
But unlike Jobs he actually invented something, the Conveyor Belt Assembly line that is used in nearly every factory today.
Jobs was a despicable person and he never invented anything.
EDIT: WOW thanks for the gold...

[–]IronGnome 75 points 13 days ago 
But Ford didn't invent the conveyor belt assembly line, the conveyor belt was in use long before and assembly lines were patented by Ransom Olds in 1901 (Ford's first conveyor belt assembly line started rolling in 1913). The idea of putting the two together probably happened at Ford first but Henry Ford wasn't the one who thought of it but rather one of his employees. So much like Jobs he gets a lot of credit for things other people invented.

[–]whatisyournamemike 23 points 13 days ago 
In 1855, Colt opened what was the world’s largest private armament factory, in which he employed advanced manufacturing techniques such as interchangeable parts and an organized production line. By 1856, the company could produce 150 weapons per day. http://www.history.com/topics/inventions/samuel-colt

What are you talking about? He invented the rectangle with round corners! How much better does it get?

[–]EejitEinstien 8 points 13 days ago 
The sources I have read all say that Old's (this is the same guy as "Oldsmobile") invented the Assembly line and Ford (not one of his employees) added conveyor belts to it.
I may be wrong, but do you have a source saying it was one of his employees...
Thanks.

[–]IronGnome 7 points 13 days ago 
I just read the the wikipedia article on assembly lines (didn't check the sources though, I'm a bad person). Talks about a bunch of guys contributing but mainly someone called William "Pa" Klann.

[–]NFLinPDX 1 point 13 days ago 
Ford Motor Company did it first and Henry got credit, due to founding his eponymous automobile manufacturer. As I remember it, it was the application to the industry that made Ford famous as previous vehicles were prohibitively expensive.

[–]voyagingwww.abolitionist.com 1 point 13 days ago

Steve Jobs is great at taking credit for others work

[–]SelfAwareAsian 3 points 13 days ago 
Henry Ford didn't actually invent the assembly line. That is a misconception. It says so in the second line of his Wikipedia page. "Although Ford did not invent the automobile or the assembly line, he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle class Americans could afford." Granted I think he did show how effecitve it could be and revolutionized the industry and world by doing so. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford

Olds invented the Assembly line...
Ford added Conveyor Belts to make it "the Conveyor Belt Assembly Line"

[–]bostonian15 -5 points 13 days ago 
Ford unlike Jobs was a very active sympathizer of Adolf Hitler and wrote a book that you should read The international Jew: The world's foremost problem to understand that inventing something means nothing when you are just a damn racist like Henry Ford was.

How many conductors are celebrated after they die?

Yup, he was still the boss when his son Edsel died in 1943, so yes for 1940.

[–]vicinthetub[🍰] 1 point 13 days ago 
Are you sure that he was personally helping Hitler, or were the factories just seized?

[–]bostonian15 2 points 13 days ago 
See for yourself, there is ample evidence (historical research) that supports a collaboration with Nazi Germany.

[–]FUCK_MY_PROLAPSE 1 point 13 days ago 
I love talking about Henry Ford all because of my 8th grade History report. Had to write a two or more pages on him. That was fucking impossible after reading about him.
I got a lot of points taken off for turning in too many pages. The teacher commented on it saying that although it was one of the best papers he had read it was far too long. Took my A grade down to a C.
I didn't even give a fuck because I learned a lot. Henry Ford is cool in a historical sense.

[–]HeroYoojin 1 point 13 days ago 
Henry Ford got famous for fighting an uphill battle against the auto hegemony which held the patent for internal combustion. He won and democratized prices for automobiles. He did this starting in 1907, and Hitler was still a rugrat.

[–]bostonian15 2 points 13 days ago 
And yet he was still a solid racist human being.

[–]HeroYoojin 1 point 12 days ago 
Yeah but who was Steve Jobs?

[–]voyagingwww.abolitionist.com 1 point 13 days ago 
Hitler had Ford's picture in his office, not the other way around. Unless they both did or something.

[–]mbbird 66 points 13 days ago 
How do the plethora of movies about him spin this? He sounds like a dumbass.

[–]EejitEinstien 137 points 13 days ago 
He was a master salesman....
That is more manipulation of peoples emotions than the kind of intelligence needed for critical thinking.
Pirates of Silicon Valley does it quite nicely.... it shows Bill Gates as a ruthless genius, Steve Wozniak as a naive genius and Jobs as a charlatan salesmen who messed with peoples emotions. According to every source I have read closely linked to all three, this is more or less accurate...

[–]meekrobe 16 points 13 days ago

Such a dumbass, I mean he was only worth Billions and built on of the largest companies in recent history. I am assuming you are doing a lot better than him? You understand that regardless of what you have to say he was able to accomplish certain tasks better than 99.99999% of the people, he was successful in certain aspects. Can you really point to someone that is "fully" successful in all aspects of their life?
Take Steve Wozniak.. in my book he is fairly close to one of those rare cases of "successful" all around. But wait.. lets take a look at this farther, maybe if Wozniak was a bit more cutthroat and like Jobs he would have continued to invent and created crazy new technologies.
I'm sorry to pick on you but when you call someone a dumbass especially Steve Jobs (popular person to hate on Reddit) all I can think is that you are either A. Steve Wozniak, in which case I agree. (probability 1:7.15Billion) B. Are a dirty fucking internet hipster a plague worse than real hipsters. C. Love talking out your ass.
I am going with B and C

[–]UristMcBrogrammer 4 points 13 days ago 
Lucky, charismatic and smart enough for the job. I don't find him that interesting though and while impressive, his priorities kind of go against all the things I tend to love about tech and computers.
I think of Jobs about the same as I think of Trump.

Lol I'm allowed to think someone is dumb for going on a fruit cleanse instead of treating his early cancer with reliable medicine only if I have made as much money as him.
You, too, would even agree with me if I had this large sum of money! Amazing! This post really writes itself!

[–]imanze -4 points 13 days ago 
Just like success can be measured by more than just money... It can also be measured by legacy, and money just as fairly. Or do we exclude those? You stated that he was simply stupid, thus it's easy to extrapolate if he's so stupid and your so smart you should be bathing in success of some kind. Could the simple truth be that he was successful and smart; but very far from perfect... Just like with everything perfection is a bit hard. Sure he was stupid FOR treating his cancer in the way he did. In the end it was his decision to make, not yours. Sure he let his own 'image' get to his head, but he created a large amount of wealth for many people. Hundreds of thousands of people have jobs because of him, and millions have devices they use daily and enjoy (even if you don't enjoy them). Would it have been great if he donated more to charity? Obviously... But why is that a demand, why not of everyone? Sure he stepped on people's back to get to where he was; name one person who didn't?
I return to my initial assessment, please take off your lensless thick frame glasses and blow em out your butt.

A thousand start ups tried to do what he did and failed too.

[–]EejitEinstien 4 points 13 days ago 
They either didn't have his money.... (later on)
Or they didn't have Wozniak's brain power. (arly on)
At the end of the day all he was, was a salesman. He sold his product better than the other guy. Had Jobs never met Wozniak:
Wozniak's computers might have failed.....
but Jobs definitely would have ended up just selling used cars, or drugs or something of the like.

[–]karmaisanal 0 points 13 days ago* 
Do you think he might have made some good strategic decisions too? Do you think he might have scoured the world for the best designers and not interfered as most people would have done with their designs? Good product focus? Good marketing? Good broadening of product base? I am not a fan boy at all. Apple was failing before they bought him back: its share price was going through the floor. The all in one computer was his decision, it was his decision to stick with the radical design, it was a massive success. There is a LOT more to it than that. A lot of mid sized computer companies, some with a bag full of geniuses behind them failed. Sinclair, BBC micro, Amstrad... - it is a long list.
Edit: Being downvoted for not saying Jobs would have just been a drug dealer. Reddit I give up. As someone who had a long exchange with Jobs about the direction Apple should take I am really fucking saddened by how wrong this is.

[–]du44 -2 points 13 days ago 
Because he has a total rags to riches story. On top of that, he stood up to the tech companies of the time and thrived. He also allowed for widespread personal computers. And he almost singlehandedly saved Apple from being bankrupt. Remember before they made him the CEO? Everyone was trying to write Apple's obituary. And then Jobs came in and got shit done. I don't give a shit if he was a nice guy or not, that's not my relationship with him. It's like if I listen to Taylor Swift. She seems like a bitch. But I honestly don't give a shit because I don't listen to her because I think she's a good person.

[–]EejitEinstien 5 points 13 days ago 
And he almost singlehandedly caused Apple being bankrupt. Remember before they made him the CEO the second time?
FTFY
He was thrown out of the position for his incompetence... he was only allowed to return when they had exhausted all other alternatives. In reality he took Apple from bigger than Microsoft to its deathbed and then brought it halfway back.(Microsoft is still bigger and that is all on Jobs being out done by Gates the first time round)
At the end of the day...Steve Wozniak, and Bill Gates both did more for us ( directly advancing technology more), were more competent at their positions, we also rags to riches stories and generally better people.
Steve Jobs is largely loved because of his ability to sell himself...
There are hundreds of people who should be celebrated before Jobs...
Just like no one in there right mind would celebrate Taylor Swift (who isn't a rags to riches story BTW) as a great person over let's say, Elvis, the Beatles, The Rolling Stones. At the end of the day she really isn't all that different from Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera. (Neither really innovators in music either)
Likewise Jobs was just a salesman and a CEO (and not even that fantastic a CEO he made HUGE mistakes before recovering). There are plenty of CEO's who could be honoured before Jobs (because they did more, did it better and gave back afterwards) .

Mac, iPhone, iPad. He didn't invent them but made them consumer friendly enough so that they became popular and the result was the same: without him you wouldn't have a shiny android smartphone, or a surface pro, or at least not that developed. Ever tried a smartphone before the iPhone and a MP3 player before the iPod?

[–]DemeaningSarcasm -2 points 13 days ago 
I feel as though Steve jobs was just stupid enough to be with the smart people. He was the first person to see what people wanted, not what the tech could produce. It's a small difference. But it's the reason why some people become researchers, and other people become industrial designers. its the difference between super computers and laptop computers. One thing is important for the field. The other thing is important for consumers. But engineers in general want to keep pushing their engineering ability. So they develop better processes or systems. But it ignores what people want.
I count Steve jobs as probably the patron saint of all industrial designers.

[–]EejitEinstien 0 points 13 days ago 
But he had industrial designers....he hired the best.
All he really did was give them free reign to go over the engineers and come straight to him.
He was a salesman if he could have sold what the engineers wanted better, he would have. The problem is it is easier for a salesman to sell industrial design (things like "sleek" and "beautiful" are things anyone can understand) than it is to sell engineering.
Why anyone would make a salesman "the patron saint" of their profession over an actual practitioner of it is beyond me.

[–]GoldenBough -3 points 13 days ago 
He was really good at getting people to give 100%. And he had the good eye to promote excellence. He was also pragmatic enough to give his company a good structure for after he was gone. A total asshole? Absolutely. But results talk.

directly responsible
No, the people who worked for him, with him (Wozniak/Gates), or that apple stole from (Xerox Palo Alto) are directly responsible they are the ones who shifted technology...he is indirectly responsible by funding/selling their inventions.
At the end of the day he was just a salesman.

It's true that he worked with brilliant people but do you actually think it's some kind of accident that one guy was involved with all of these projects. Because if you do then you're either really naive or really misguided by your irrational hatred of Apple. For one you're just completely overlooking the fact that Jobs was very involved with the design for Apple's products throughout both of his tenures there.

I actually like a lot of what they do.
Jobs contributions were purely superficial...the fact is he was a salesman interfering in the engineering because of sales not some grand industrial designer. He was a salesman but unique among salesmen...if he couldn't sell something he had the power to change it.
do you actually think it's some kind of accident that one guy was involved with all of these projects
No like I said he was very good at selling himself. Convincing people you are valuable, and actually contributing value are two very different things.

[–]BattleStag17 29 points 13 days ago

My thoughts. As much as I may hate on people for going all New Age when they get cancer or whatever, I also realize my mental state (not to mention financial state) would put me in a VERY bad place if I watched my body go through Chemo or something. Throw in a less than 75% rate of recovery or something and I'll probably choose to just go out my own way instead of turning into a near corpse for a few years before probably dying anyways....

[–]BattleStag17 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm the exact opposite, since my dad beat cancer thanks to chemotherapy. It's cool to be New Age, but if your life is in danger then for god's sake you owe it to yourself to use every bit of science available.

The former. Even in Canada, where we have free health care, partners in law firms/accounting firms/upper execs all get like half-day physicals. They're too important to the organization to lose.

[–]blindsight 1 point 13 days ago 
Right. I meant relative to pancreatic cancer diagnoses, he had just about the highest chance of surviving of the population. A much higher chance than anyone can reasonably claim with alternative medicine.
With his early diagnosis and access to the best doctors and treatments, he had a very good survival rate, relatively.

F-fruit cleanse? Why...why? Wait so he ate nothing but fruit? Hold the fuck on, is this shit supposed to be ironic, because apples are fruit? Is this real life? If you eat nothing but fruit, you will lower the ph of your body significantly, creating a wonderful environment for cancer to grow in. The man should've gone off cheese, meat, and processed foods/foods grown with pesticides, hormones and antibiotics etc. Fruit and vegetables, man. You need something basic raise your ph, or that cancer will gobble you up before you can say gazorpazorpfield.

[–]mike413 103 points 13 days ago 
You know, he's lying. I'll bet the philanthropy thing is a distant second.
This is annoying myth #1 he hates:
QUESTION: I read in a newspaper that in 1981 you said, "640K of memory should be enough for anybody.'' What did you mean when you said this?
ANSWER: I've said some stupid things and some wrong things, but not that. No one involved in computers would ever say that a certain amount of memory is enough for all time.
The need for memory increases as computers get more potent and software gets more powerful. In fact, every couple of years the amount of memory address space needed to run whatever software is mainstream at the time just about doubles. This is well-known.
When IBM introduced its PC in 1981, many people attacked Microsoft for its role. These critics said that 8-bit computers, which had 64K of address space, would last forever. They said we were wastefully throwing out great 8-bit programming by moving the world toward 16-bit computers.
We at Microsoft disagreed. We knew that even 16-bit computers, which had 640K of available address space, would be adequate for only four or five years. (The IBM PC had 1 megabyte of logical address space. But 384K of this was assigned to special purposes, leaving 640K of memory available. That's where the now-infamous "640K barrier'' came from.)
A few years later, Microsoft was a big fan of Intel's 386 microprocessor chip, which gave computers a 32-bit address space.
Modern operating systems can now take advantage of that seemingly vast potential memory. But even 32 bits of address space won't prove adequate as time goes on.
Meanwhile, I keep bumping into that silly quotation attributed to me that says 640K of memory is enough. There's never a citation; the quotation just floats like a rumor, repeated again and again.

[–]GoldenBough 4 points 13 days ago

[–]Best_Towel_EU 4 points 12 days ago 
Keep your pαnts on, we're not moving from 64 bit αny time soon. The mαximum αmount of RAM α 64 bit processor cαn support is 16.8 million terαbytes, αnd I wαnt to be quoted αs sαying α personαl computer will never need more thαn 16.8 million TB of rαm.

[–]gormlesser 1 point 13 days ago 
Modern operating systems can now take advantage of that seemingly vast potential memory. But even 32 bits of address space won't prove adequate as time goes on.
I wonder when he said that. 32 bits in address corresponds to 4 gigabytes of memory, so we're way past that in 2015 with 64 bit address space. 64 bits = 16 exabytes of memory. 1 exabyte is 1018 bytes = 1000000000000000000 bytes. When will that no longer be enough and what will we be doing with all that space?

[–]Notorious4CHAN 4 points 13 days ago 
I just did about 30 minutes of research and didn't come up with any hard estimates, but based on historical trends and "every couple of years the amount of memory address space needed to run whatever software is mainstream at the time just about doubles. This is well-known." I'd peg it at roughly 40 years to enter the consumer market.
It is hard to imagine what we might do with all that memory. Maybe it will never enter the consumer market. After all, 16 exabytes should be enough for anyone.

I had a professor once tell me that we will soon run into a wall with Moore's Law. Apparently before long they will be putting the transistors so close together that their sub-atomic fields will interact with each other, causing problems. When that happens we will be stuck where we're at, which is why so much research is going into quantum computing. Based on what I keep reading around teh webz, this seems to be true

[–]MJOLNIRdragoon 2 points 13 days ago

Really? Though they weren't 8-bit machines, there's been a running joke where people mock how eMachines used to put "Never obsolete!" on the front sticker of their prebuilt machines, leading to people thinking their computers would last forever. People are also finding their computers are lasting longer and longer as time goes on, which will eventually lead to people thinking their computers will last forever also. Technology obsoletes itself over and over every couple of years, yet it's quite common for us to hang on to old technology, whether it's to save money, or just to try and reassure ourselves that what we have is just fine.

A lifetime of proper nutrition and medical care will improve their life greatly that it would be a great trade off for the slight chance that the donor needs a new kidney or blood. There is a very small chance that he would have to die such that he gets in a fatal accident. The average life span is no more than 30-40 years and that is a life of hard labour, famine, and chronic pain compared to being provided with money and resources for an enjoyable lifetime in the slight risk that you would have to give up your life. I'm sure lots of people would be lining up for the chance.

[–]boytjie 1 point 13 days ago 
You make a good case and you are probably right. The thing is, practises like that will void a whole bunch of human right doctrines (even if it is all mainly hypocrisy) and may open the gate to other dubious practices that compromise human rights much worse.
Politically, it will be a nightmare.

IIRC his cancer was in a terminal, not even a transplant can save you, stadium when he tried to get a transplant. Before that he tried alternative remedies instead of treatments that are known to work.
So even without the time constraints (and even 5-6 hours should knock him down a lot in comparison to people living within 1 hour of the hospital) he would have ended up far away from the top of the list.

[–]JohnKinbote 41 points 13 days ago

[–]Griffin-dork 9 points 13 days ago 
He should not of been given a transplant. He was terminal and refused traditional treatments early on that would most likely have worked. People trying to justify him, I really don't know why you are doing so. Steve Jobs was a selfish prick in pretty much every sense. He wasn't an engineer creating groundbreaking technology. He had engineers he told "Make something groundbreaking or you're fired". He was a marketing strategist with the only goal to be to make as much money as possible. There is nothing wrong with that, as long as you admit it instead of try to insist you are bettering the world and society.

[–]veggiter 5 points 13 days ago 
I'd argue there is something wrong with that and that it's responsible for most of the world's mand-made ills.

[–]robbylp 0 points 13 days ago 
Everyone sins - don't tell me everyone who has had a transplant has been an angel. You start putting moral criteria for medical care on people - when does it end? The only part in your comment I will semi-agree with is refusing traditional treatments - that should cause negative points on the list for sure.

[–]Griffin-dork 5 points 13 days ago 
I'm not imposing moral criteria on medical care for people. I'm saying he shouldn't of gotten one under normal circumstances. He used his elite status to get one ahead of other people after refusing traditional treatment and was terminal. Someone who is terminal should not have priority over someone who has the chance to take the transplant and live a mostly healthy life afterwards.

It would have happened without him. Maybe it would have taken a few more years, five at most but smart phones with touch screens were in development at other companies.

Maybe, but it didn't. I know he's just good at the marketing but can you tell me the scientist behind all the medicine you use? Probably not, but you can tell me the corporation that makes and sells it from someone else's work. It's just the way it is with these things.

[–]chrisp909 1 point 13 days ago 
There's no "maybe" about it. Tech moves forward, he was at the right place at the right time, tha't all.
He got really lucky with his Ipod and bet the farm with the iPhone that he could kill the Blackberry. He won, this time.
If he hadn't Microsoft probably wouldn't have bailed Apple out a second time.

[–]Divine_E 5 points 13 days ago 
No, no he didn't. He never invented anything, he was a marketer, that's it. He paid people to be innovative for him. He just told them if it would sell or not, and got them to change it until it did sell.

[–]Divine_E 5 points 13 days ago 
Innovation was dead before that. Apple had been copying ideas Android already had on the market for months. They patented things like "swipe to unlock" and called it innovation. Jobs was not directly responsible for any of Apple's innovations. He just guided development so that the products would sell to the common consumer.
You know who actually innovates, and helps us progress as a society? People like Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, and Dennis Ritchie. People who actually work on things that improve technology. Not people who are able to market it. Jobs didn't care about making the world a better place, he just wanted to make a buck.

Not only that but after he got the transplant he refused to comply with doctors and chose to do wholistic medicine which put his new liver in rejection pretty quick after the transplant. I have had two liver transplants and I can't even explain how much he pisses me off. (Typing this on an iPad, I know I am a damn hypocrite)

[–]Takeabyte 1 point 13 days ago 
It's not unethical, it's what someone is able to do when they have enough resources to do it. There are a lot of requirements to qualify for a transplant and to have a high meld score there's more to it than just being on the list.

[–]Paddy_Tanninger 1 point 13 days ago 
In fairness, if I had a few billion, or even a few hundred million...it would literally make no difference to my life to give away a hundred million.
So yeah we can sit there and analyze what percentage of his money he gave, but at the end of the day money isn't a relative thing, and a guy earning $1Bn a year doesn't have all of his expenses scale up to be 10,000x of someone earning $100K a year.
Looked at that way, Tim Cook's $100M would be like $10,000 for me...and honestly I couldn't swing that, it's just not possible. Between rent, childcare, and trying to save for retirement and a house, I don't have $10K left over, let alone $10K to give away.
Meanwhile if I made $1B a year and gave away $100M...I'd have $900M to live off. That's like $880M more than I'd ever know what to do with still.

Tim Cook started a charitable gift matching program, almost immediately after he took over as CEO. All full-time employees are eligible, even Apple Retail employees. (So if an apple employee donates $100 to a charity, Apple tosses in another $100, up to $10,000/employee/year.")

[–]rollerboogie 1 point 13 days ago 
Yeah. I mean I have no issues with companies themselves not giving money to charity. It doesn't really make sense imo. Companies exist to be businesses and make profit. 'Apple' or 'Google' only donate money because they have a lot and want the good PR.
People should donate. Stockholders make profit from stock which they can give away. Employees can donate. Etc.
The fact that Steve Jobs did almost no philanthropy is pretty sad. Especially considering that he was adopted and all of that. You'd think he'd have a lot of empathy for charities and all that.

[–]_worstusername 1 point 13 days ago 
Jobs cancelled the matching gift company back when Apple was days away from filing bankruptcy. They had to make a ton of hard decisions to stop themselves from going under. Most people nowadays really don't remember how close Apple was to disappearing completely.

[–]rollerboogie 1 point 13 days ago 
Yeah, but they've been way out of bankruptcy since the ipod. Which was like over 10 years ago.

The market landscape is different than it was when he was in charge. Steve was always driven by helping artists create. If a stylus allowed creators to do things they hadn't been able to do before he might have pursued it were he alive.

He was a very passionate man, and I don't think money was his main motivator. He fought to highlight design and art in technology in a time when it was run by engineers without a vision of how to connect with normal people and artists.

[–]iwillnotgetaddicted 1 point 13 days ago 
I definitely think he was good at thinking about how people would use his product, and he was incredibly talented and driven to make sure that experience was a positive one.
As far as actually being motivated by the desire to aid in the creation of works of art, I remain skeptical. Did he do anything to support those artists? He had a lot of money, so if that were his priority, wouldn't he, I dunno, fund a museum to display digital art, become a patron of a digital artist, or something along those lines?

He made technology that people could actually connect with on an emotional level and thus helped people work and create like they never had before. In addition to that, making technology that was actually beautiful and well-designed was a big part of why Apple's products have such a following. Sophistication and luxury are about attention to details, and with that comes a higher price. A Honda Civic will get you to work at the same time as a BMW, but the attention to detail and the experience of driving won't be there. Most people are fine with an economy car, but there's always a market for those types of people who appreciate design and experience.

[–]jkimtrolling 2 points 13 days ago 
Sorry but your analogy is terrible, and I don't say that lightly. The components in a BMW are incredible quality, which would imply the same with Apple and thats simply not the case compared to the market. It also implies the Civic has(had) features for many sales cycles before they hit higher priced BMWs.

[–]FogItNozzel 2 points 13 days ago 
The components in a BMW are incredible quality.
LOL. Is that why my BMW has needed Injectors, turbos (twice), three high pressure fuel pumps, a waterpump, and a host of other components in its 8 year life?

[–]Phobos1393 1 point 13 days ago 
It depends on your definition of quality. Honda has a much better reliability record than BMW, even on engines, which discounts the possibility of it only being due to a more simplistic interior with less electronics. This implies that Honda's components are actually higher quality. But in actuality, your criticism isn't really relevant since it misses the point of his analogy. He's saying that the difference isn't in the quality of components or features (which may or may not be, doesn't matter. I could make up an imaginary car company to make this analogy true and the point would still get across), there is a strong difference in driver "experience", which has to do with how the whole package subjectively feels to drivers while in use, regardless of numerical performance or reliability numbers.
Let's take this example to performance cars since you seem to have issues with Honda and BMW. The McLaren MP4-12C was literally built to just be better than the Ferrari 458 Italia in every measurable aspect, but when Top Gear reviewed both of them they found that the MP4-12C was much less enjoyable to drive and had a experience that felt sterile, and like you couldn't connect with it on an emotional level, and for that reason they felt like the 458 Italia was still a better car regardless of raw performance numbers.

Tim Cook was an operations guy, I think one of the improvements they've made is in supply chain environmentalism. I don't know how this translates into for say Foxconn workers, but I think I read that they exceed the RoHS and conflict minerals regulations, for example. Also they are trying to make their facilities eco-friendly, i.e. self-sustaining from the grid, I believe.

[–]Craishton 36 points 13 days ago 
(besides highly dubious reports of secretive donations to unknown causes, unaligned with his own comments on the matter)
I don't know what makes them "highly dubious". His wife Laurene Powell Jobs has literally worked full time with charity since the late 90s, so if you think that none of his money went to charity you're delusional. He was just a highely private person. How much do you know about his personal life? Barely anything, which is obviously how he liked it. It's a sick world where doing good isn't worth anything if you're not telling everyone about it.

[–]Brevard1986 17 points 13 days ago 
I don't even think it's a matter of telling anybody. Lots of rich people give to charity privately. But how many of them did it in a fashion where it genuinely made an impact? When it comes to personal wealth measuring in the billions, the amount of effective change you can make destroys most shady veils despite how secreterative you live your life. If Jobs did something globally impactful in the philanthropy world, people would know.
Jobs was probably just another rich person giving a substantial amount to various charity which is absolutely fine in my book. People can do whatever they want to do with their money.

[–]Keyboard_Cat_ 11 points 13 days ago 
Agreed. When you're talking a huge donation in the 10s of millions, it always gets leaked. There just aren't secret donations of that size, despite what people in this thread would like to believe.
Source: Have been working for non-profits for years. When you get to a more local scale, people can't even hide their 6 figure donations.

[–]Condawg 1 point 13 days ago 
Not to mention, he was very into Buddhism. They believe giving to charity shouldn't reap any benefits, and being public about it to boost yourself is a clear benefit. I don't think Jobs was the best person in the world, but I wouldn't doubt at all that he gave to charity and just kept it to himself.

[–]valiantjared 20 points 13 days ago

My comment is applicable to you. Your comment was not applicable to OP. Let me explain how the comment tree works with reddit. There are high level comments which are direct comments to the original post or poster. When you reply to a comment, you are making a comment on that comment, not necessarily the original post. Thus, me telling you that you that you're just spouting off useless information is an attempt at educating you for the future.

[–]CJSBiliskner 8 points 13 days ago 
There seems to always be this idea that anyone involved in Buddhism or Shinto or the "enlightened" Asian religions are automatically great people just because those religions outwardly display such great ideas and beliefs. My parents and I are moderate Buddhists, and as far as I've seen, there's an equally massive variance in the moral actions of Buddhists as there is in Christians, or Muslims, or any other religion. The point is, just because someone is Buddhist, they don't automatically follow all the ideals of Buddhism. Just like you know, any other religion.

[–]WeeGigas 5 points 13 days ago 
Considering how it took years of denial and a paternity test to make Steve pay $500/month in child-support to his 1st daughter I don't think the Buddhists teachings translated to other aspects of his life.

[–]Condawg 1 point 13 days ago 
I don't know where I said he was a good person. Being charitable doesn't automatically make someone a good person, and being a good person doesn't automatically mean you're charitable. All I'm saying is he had reason to keep his charitable contributions private, if he did, in fact, make charitable contributions. The fact of the matter is nobody knows, other than maybe people who were personally close with him.

[–]politicalwave 0 points 13 days ago 
When a guy colluded with other companies to nickel and dime people over eBook prices, I am highly skeptical of anything philanthropic attributed to him/his legacy. I am willing to believe his wife might have done plenty, I don't believe he really cared about much besides his company. Not saying he should either, I don't think the rich owe us anything when we foolishly pad their wallets, I just don't like us all patting them on the backs while we do it. I hold Musk, Gates and Buffet in a category separate from the rich I am describing, and include Jobs in with the rest. Just IMO.

[–]Craishton -1 points 13 days ago 
All I can say is that I find it pretty funny that you can't see anything good ever coming from Jobs because he tried to wrestle away the ebook monopoly from Amazon as the same time as you hail Gates as a saint.
Sure, Steve Jobs was the kind of person that would screw someone over because he simply didn't care, but Gates was the kind of person that would scew someone over because he enjoyed it. Jobs was the kind of person that would cheat his friend of a few thousand dollar, but Gates was the kind of person that tried to cheat his friend and co-founder of Microsoft of shares worth billions of dollar when he had freaking cancer.

[–]politicalwave 2 points 13 days ago 
I find it amusing that I can't appreciate the bounty of effort Gates and Buffet have put into their charitable work while noting that Jobs is undeserving of similar praise.
Get off his lap.
Edit: I'll agree that they're both dickheads, just one is more beneficial to society and gets less praise for it. The other told a bunch of people smarter than him to make a product look sexy then proceeded to rip off his customers (many of which were public schools).

[–]mathyouhunt 0 points 13 days ago 
I think all he's saying is that he thinks it's crazy for people to hold him up as some sort of saint. Jobs did a great job marketing his products, and his software design was top-notch, but he wasn't much of a philanthropic guy.
I love my old iPods, and they're leading multiple markets right now (for good reason, too), but way too many people thought he was some sort of messiah.

[–]Craishton 2 points 13 days ago 
I don't think that there are nowhere close to as many people that thinks that he was a saint, as there are people who think that he was some kind of cartoonish bad guy, literally eating live kittens for breakfast. Just look at the guy I responded to - 2.5k upvotes and Reddit gold x2.

[–]mathyouhunt 1 point 13 days ago 
For all I know, you may very well be right. However, the number of "Steve jobs is a hero" tshirts, images, etc. that went became popular around the time of his passing would be the other end of the spectrum. The number of prayer-circles and group mourning events that went around at the time was pretty nuts. I think a good portion of the backlash around Reddit is really just that: backlash.
I agree that the Jobs-bashing that goes around the net is ridiculous, he was no worse than any other businessman, but I see it as opposition to the equally ridiculous notion that he was a saint.
The reality is (hopefully) somewhere in between; he was a great businessman, head of a large company, and a sad case of cancer taking another person. I think that's the best way to look at it.

[–]los_angeles -2 points 13 days ago 
Yeah I tend to agree with this line of thinking. The irony of being an anonymous donor: people think you're more of a prick than people who said "LOOK AT ME, I'M DONATING MONEY! LOOK AT MY NAME ON THIS SHINY BUILDING. DON'TCHA THINK I'M SUCH A GOOD GUY?!"

[–]neovngr 2 points 13 days ago 
The irony of being an anonymous donor: people think you're more of a prick than people who said "LOOK AT ME,
People don't think this at all. In fact, I think that, upon finding out someone had 'secretively' donated, a higher level of reverence would be had than if they had told you themselves.

[–]los_angeles 0 points 13 days ago 
The point of being a secret donor is that no one finds out.
Anyway, I'm saying that people like redditcMetastasizae, the guy who started this subthread is sort of proving my point. Jobs could well be an anonymous donor but we just sit here calling him an asshole.

[–]Keyboard_Cat_ 1 point 13 days ago 
Man, people in this thread are trying SO HARD to show that Jobs probably did donate a ton of money to charity. He's just such a nice guy he kept it secret. /s
The thing is, secret donations almost never remain secret because they are reported to the IRS and leak that way. Seriously, look into it, once you're talking 10s of millions or more, they ALWAYS get leaked. So maybe just face up to the fact that your idol was very good at business, very innovative, but also a pretty selfish dude who was not a philanthropist. And leave it at that, because that's OK.

[–]los_angeles -1 points 13 days ago 
I would take the (terribly strange, I know) position that I don't actually know anything about what he did in his private life and that I should therefore withhold my judgment. I know that's very challenging for you millennials, etc.
Also, the IRS doesn't leak taxpayer info.

[–]Keyboard_Cat_ 1 point 13 days ago 
That is so incredibly naive. The IRS doesn't leak info as an organization, but the people do. That's why truly anonymous huge donations are not a thing. Always leaked. The same way that celebrity interactions with police are always leaked. It is not the policy of the police to go straight to the media, but there is money to be made for individual officers.

[–]los_angeles 1 point 13 days ago 
Do you have evidence of this or are you just pulling this out of your ass?
There's plenty of anonymous donations.

[–]Keyboard_Cat_ 1 point 12 days ago 
I've worked at ACS for the last 21 years. So many anonymous donations have come through in that time, many of them huge. There has literally never been a single one over a million dollars that didn't get leaked. My coworkers and all the other charities I work with say the same.

[–]los_angeles 1 point 12 days ago 
Just because ACS leaks does not mean the IRS does. There are criminal penalties for IRS employees who leak info. Plenty of charities/non profits (e.g., Ivy League schools) are not that sloppy.

One thing we do know, he turned to holistic medicine when he had a good survival rate.

Totally agree. One of the main reasons I've never been an "Apple guy" is because of their greedy corporate image.

Yeah but it's hardly anything, a whopping $70 million since the program started. So at about $7 million a year... They probably spend more then that on toilet paper in a year.

[–]funyunsgood 1 point 13 days ago 
So Apple's efforts should be discounted because they didn't give "enough"? Every single person and company can always give more than they do. "Enough" is subjective.
In addition to Product Red Apple has led the charge by being one of the best corporate examples when it comes to environmental responsibility.
They also support education in so many ways. The educational efforts are not very cohesive or public but the point is they care and give to many causes.

[–]Takeabyte 1 point 13 days ago 
No the point is that what they do for charity is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction... It's very little. It would be like if I gave a penny to a homeless person and then patted myself on the back for the next year because of all the good I did.

They also did this not out of charity but as a form to bribe locals into voting for politicans who would push the legislation they wanted past for their companies. This was before the time of direct lobbying, so if you want to get certain stuff passed, then you had to directly bribe the voters, or the local leaders. This is why there's so many 'donated by wealthy industrialist' churches and church organs. They would pay off the preacher in the form of a charitable donation, and then the preacher would tell his flock about how nice mr. so and so is and why we should support his initiative to do x y and z.

I've often wondered about this. But it's not Apple "buying" a university. Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller(Who also founded The University of Chicago) and others simply made a very large monetary donation to help found the new school.
I don't see what the problem is. It's not as if Apple will somehow shape the curriculum or ideology of the school other than supporting a strong STEM concentration.
My concern is that to found a truly elite school, the costs may simply be too high.
Edit: Apparently the article actually wants Apple to buy a University. Which is a horrible and stupid idea. Let Apple follow what the Industrialists did and just throw a bunch of money at it.

[–]crossfirehurricane 129 points 14 days ago 
Not that I'm disagreeing with you, but the curriculum at the Walton School of Business in the University of Arkansas is heavily influenced by Walmart. It's still a good school and ranked pretty high nationally, but you can really feel the presence of Walmart in the classes and on campus.

It's because the use of 'a' or 'an' is not determined by the actual first first letter of the following word but rather by its phoneme, i.e. its sound. And since the sound of the 'u' in university is rather a 'you', it is a university instead of an university.

Many universities have their curriculum influenced by the organizations that hire their graduates. It's a mutually beneficial relationship: students want jobs, universities want their graduates to get jobs, companies want good employees. I've noticed it a lot in my IS programs. Each university has a different concentration based somewhat on the needs of the largest employers in the area.

[–]Karakov 2 points 13 days ago 
Hey, would you be able to elaborate on what IS actually is like? I'm thinking about majoring in that.

[–]phalangion 1 point 13 days ago 
IS is great! It's a cross between CS and business in most schools. Typically focuses more on the management side of IT work. Do you have any specific questions about it?
Full disclosure: I teach it now.

[–]Karakov 2 points 13 days ago 
What kind of things does somebody with an IS degree do on a daily basis?

[–]phalangion 1 point 13 days ago 
It varies widely by the direction you decide to go with your work. You could work managing an IT department or a software team, or you could go into an accounting firm and work on either IT audits or consulting. Those are just a couple of the job options.

[–]Thirdfanged 2 points 13 days ago 
What does IS stand for?
With what sort of position opening would an IS degree be considered a benefit?
What sort of curriculum did you go through to obtain that IS degree?

[–]phalangion 1 point 13 days ago 
IS stands for Information Systems. Some places call this Management Information Systems, or MIS.
IS grads do a lot of different things, depending on their interests. Many become business or systems analysts. A lot of grads for my undergrad went to work in accounting firms doing either IT audits or their IT consulting. Where I'm at now, a lot end up in the bigger companies in the area working for their IS departments designing and developing business systems.
My BS had three programming classes, two database courses, two networking courses, and two systems analysis and design classes. That was the IS core of the program. Then I took business classes like marketing, finance, accounting, and ethics. Depending on your interests, you could be more toward the programming side and take web or mobile development electives. Or you could do more on the management side with project management or similar courses.
Happy to answer other questions. IS (with different names) shows up three times in this list of the top 30 best paying majors, and a number 8 on Forbes' list of valuable college majors. It's not as algorithmically intense as a CS program would be, but you still get to play with all the cool toys.

[–]crossfirehurricane 2 points 13 days ago

Just curious, how could you feel the presence? What made it stand out?

[–]crossfirehurricane 1 point 13 days ago* 
I only took business classes up to my sophomore year before switching majors but a lot of the examples given in classes are Walmart related. A lot of the stuff taught is similar to how Walmart operates and they recruit heavily from the business college.
But we do have a really nice mini Walmart on campus. I think it was one of the first, if not the first, university specific Walmarts. Kind of like the neighborhood market ones

Let's not forget that Rockefeller, Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, and the other giants of that age had waaaaaay more money than the richest of rich people have today.
"By the time Rockefeller died in 1937, his assets equaled 1.5% of America's total economic output. To control an equivalent share today would require a net worth of about $340 billion dollars, more than four times that of Bill Gates, currently the world's richest man."

Your logic makes no sense. Having a larger percentage of America's total economic output doesn't equal having more money. The only fact you can take from that statement is the wealth gap was larger at the time, they had way more money than everyone else alive at the time. But considering our economic output along with total population have increased tremendously since then, it makes perfect sense the top 1% don't have as large of a percentage as people in the past. That doesn't mean they don't have as much money, they almost certainly have more than any humans in history.

[–]sgilbert2013 3 points 13 days ago 
It isn't even my logic. Tell that to Forbes I guess. All I was saying is that those top individuals had way more money, and they did.

There's nothing in it for any companies to do this. Stanford, UC Berkeley, MIT, and a huge amount of other schools already produce top tier talent. Let's say a company does manage to spend tens of billions of dollars to build an elite university, now what? They have programmers who work for them? These companies all already had a huge amount of talent willing to work for them that are trained at no personal cost to themselves. Why would they need to add to the pool of talent?

[–]CitizenOfTennessee 1 point 13 days ago 
I think how companies like Google have figured out how to give us so much for free (email, storage, web services, etc...) they and others (Apple, Amazon, etc...) will figure out how to do the same with education. Things governments simply cannot do and aren't willing to do.

I'm not sure that Google is really this infallible benevolent master. They are driven by profit just as much as Apple and despite what they say, most of what they do on the side is also aimed at one day increasing profit.
It would really be best for a group of Philanthropists to put together an amazing sum and have a group of Elite Universities design a truly 21st century curriculum. Think Cornell and Technion's Cornell Tech campus in NYC but multiplied 100 fold.

[–]Accujack 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm not sure that Google is really this infallible benevolent master.
I didn't say they were. They do however manage to hit what they're aiming at as regards goals. I think if they tried to design a University, they'd probably do a fairly good job. Whether they'd successfully manage to separate the corporation's interests from those of the University would be a separate question.
Think Cornell and Technion's Cornell Tech campus in NYC but multiplied 100 fold.
I don't believe any of the existing colleges or Universities are ideal, or even close. Rather, I'd like to see an institution similar to universities of times past, where knowledge was pursued rather than the production of trained students.

Makes more sense for a company like Google to do this. They are the ones pushing the boundaries of information technology.

Khan Academy is good for people who already have an appetite for self-directed learning, schools are better at cultivating it (good schools anyway).

Perhaps a Google 'University' would be for people who have the initiative to progress on their own to a certain stage. Most of the people who sit in seats and are content to pass tests don't deserve to be there. The upper years would be geographically dispersed.

The other benefit of a university program is that it forces you to learn things you aren't necessarily interested in.

I know many engineering students rage against having to take liberal arts classes but it's important to be a well-rounded learner.

Yeah, it's hugely helpful. There are other software packages that you can buy that will do similar stuff. They might be better or worse, I don't know, but her school just doesn't have the budget for them. So using a free system like Khan Academy is great.
She is set up as the teacher and has a dashboard where she can see charts of how students are performing on certain skills, and how much time they are spending on them. It really helps in identifying where she needs to spend time, and how much effort the students are really putting in.
She has one student who is really gifted, and he just plows through more and more videos every day. It's encouraging for her to see a student that really gets excited about her material.

It's a matter of how you perceive teaching. Teaching is about more than a transfer of knowledge. From a cognitive perspective it's about showing you the neural pathways you have available and making you familiar with using them. In the same way teaching can be about cultivating innate skills. Any writer will tell the key to being a good writer is to keep writing. Similarly the key to being innovative is to keep innovating. In that regard a teacher can keep pushing and encouraging you in the right direction.

Or you could just put a gerbil in each nostril and one in the mouth, but that's suffocation, not drowning. So you would need to fill the lungs with gerbils. So about 6 Liters of gerbils.

[–]StressOverStrain 8 points 13 days ago 
At least in the US, becoming a licensed professional engineer requires an undergraduate degree in engineering (in addition to passing an exam and working under another licensed engineer for a few years). Somebody has to sign off on the designs as safe to build and use, and (for example) in civil engineering this requires a PE.
There's also no reason to hire someone "claiming" to have self-studied engineering when there are plenty of respectable universities churning out graduates that are guaranteed to know what they're doing.

Ya, was reading these comments about engineering and law and thinking medicine is an exception to all this. While you certainly can continue to learn in medicine, the stuff they teach you actually is really important and there is a ton of factual information that must be memorized. Guess that's why the training is so damn long. Pilot is similar. You don't want a pilot learning to fly on the job.

[–]NoahThompson59767 31 points 13 days ago 
Most of the non-medicine professionals who bash on how little they learned in college are ignoring the fact that they learned the foundations in formal schooling, and none of their later self-learning would make much sense without that previous knowledge. So sure, you learned computer language X after college, but you learned the fundamentals of what it means to be a computer language, how to determine the strengths and weaknesses of a language, etc etc, in college.

To be more precise, I learned plenty in college, just not from my professors. I self taught a lot, and I had to pay a lot of time, money, and mental health for the pleasure of doing so. My education was great, my college and "degree" was crap.

Not really though. There's an absolutely amazing research monograph from 1989 by Kralj and Bajd I wanted to read online, but it isn't available anywhere. It's cited everywhere in the literature. The book itself on Amazon costs $400 new and $200 used. Ended up getting it from the University library.

[–]Aratar2011 34 points 13 days ago* 
That's the major criticism of law school that it doesn't teach you anything substantive about lawyering. What it does do is tear down your ways of thinking, reading, and writing, and build them back from the ground up in a way that is suitable for law.

That's not what I was implying at all. Just that I found the whole thing to be very inefficient, and somewhat unpleasant. I ended up landing a pretty solid gig right before graduating, and have been advanced pretty quickly. Most of the reason for that had to do with the skills I developed outside of school.
I just think there should be a more efficient way to do higher education, and there is a lot of research that seems to echo this opinion. Unfortunately due to differences in learning styles among other things a solution is somewhat difficult to decide on.

[–]MoatJon- 3 points 13 days ago 
That's what school should be about. College actually must be about teaching you facts because that's what they sell, specialization. The fact that colleges won't be able to teach everything there is about a profession so you have to go further on your own is another differnet thing.

[–]NoahThompson59767 1 point 13 days ago 
The people who don't realize this are the ones who get annoyed because their CS class used a teaching language to demonstrate all the fundamentals of how a language works and feels, instead of jumping into how to bang out code in C++.

[–]SupriseGinger 0 points 13 days ago 
And if someone is able to do that in college I think that is great. I had various IT certs before going to college, and due to various life events had to be able to function as an adult by the time I was an early teen. As a result I just found the college experience to be tedious and somewhat condescending.
I would go to school and essentially be treated like a child. When I went to work (was doing school and work full time to support myself) interacted with people the same age as my professors as equals. I also realize I was/am somewhat of an outlier, and that I shouldn't let my experience paint the picture for everyone.
TL;DR Not everyone is at the same level/point in development when they enter college, but are treated as such.

[–]Projectrage 0 points 13 days ago 
Most new colleges are MOOC online colleges.
Stanford has been the one benefitting from the California tech sector, battling East coast Harvard.
Problem is if you are a good student at Harvard you get an A-, if you are an ok student you are a B+. Showing that grades are pointless, and students not being challenged, and the upper class secures their lineage and the university stay formed to be an exaggerated exclusive countryclub.
Some professors are angry about this and starting a new type of college that focuses on vocation. It's starting in Portland Oregon. http://www.wayfindingacademy.org

Absolutely agree. I just got my first job in finance which is not related to my degree in any way at all but I'm finding that I'm really good at it because I'm able to direct myself in a way that actually is interesting to me.

[–]fredlieblings 1 point 13 days ago 
Hopefully you're not fully throwing your education under the bus and think, say, it was ONLY a way to be able to get an interview at the job you're working. You likely learned a variety of techniques for tackling challenging problems as a result of the challenges thrown at you in college. Learning how to learn and so on.
Hopefully I'm misreading your comment, and you're not thinking your college experience was a waste of time.

[–]SupriseGinger 1 point 13 days ago 
Eh, yes and no. The degree was just a means to and end. Obviously I learned various things and techniques, but even those were self taught. Most of the professors and the college itself were pretty bad despite the school having a good reputation.
I am not a fan of school or the fact that more and more a degree is being required before anyone will look at you. I also realize I have to play the game if I want to get anywhere in life, but most of my success has come as a result of things I do outside that game.

[–]whiteknight521 5 points 13 days ago 
You need extensive training on the proper way to conduct research. The technical proficiency alone of "running experiments" would require years of supervised lab experience, which is basically what much of grad school amounts to. The scrub rate in my Ph.D. program was close to 50%. Reddit likes to think that anyone can do science, but that is far, far from the truth.

[–]UristMcBrogrammer -2 points 13 days ago 
I mean, I've done it before to an extent. I don't have a PhD or even a masters. I imagine if I took 6 years to do research, school or no, I could have at least a few published papers with at least one in a nice journal. Not for me though.
Academia likes to think it's special. The time, money and people to talk to are the truly special parts IMO. The culture can be a bit unhealthy though; even if it gets shit done.

[–]ExtremelyLongButtock 1 point 12 days ago 
I can't speak to other disciplines, but at least with lab sciences like chemistry, mentorship in at least a semi-formal capacity is 100% mandatory to developing good skills. You can't just read a procedure and go replicate the experiment.
You can read all about the theories of chemistry, you can learn nomenclature and mechanisms and reactions all by yourself, but you aren't going to be able to assemble an experiment, collect the results, interpret the data, troubleshoot it when it fucks up, turn it into a publishable paper, etc. without someone who knows the art side of the science. YouTube isn't sufficient, Khan Academy and most of the MOOC programs I've seen are theory/lecture focused, and even if videos were available, it can't compare to having some looking out for you while you're doing it the first few times.
As far as a field that "doesn't require substantial equipment", I can't think of much from the physical or life sciences that doesn't require expensive glassware or instruments or chemicals or safety equipment or specialized facilities or safe disposal protocols, or all of the above.
That's not even mentioning the importance of networking, which you can't currently get without spending at least some time in academia, even if it's just as an undergrad.
There are rumblings of a coming renaissance of "citizen scientists" via makerspaces, but they mostly operate as nonprofits, and can't really operate at the same scale as academic/publicly funded research. They're great at figuring out novel uses for new ideas and tech, but the fundamental discoveries themselves are mostly going to be coming out of academia. Biohackers will do some amazing shit with CRISPR in the coming years, but they're not going to invent the next CRISPR themselves.

[–]UristMcBrogrammer 1 point 12 days ago* 
Naaa maker spaces are meh and MOOCS are meh. Gotta download/work through graduate courses (most are pretty open even if you don't get credit) and read papers and maybe use something research gate. That's how I would do it in any case.
Chemistry is probably a bad choice for that since you need a lab and lots of lab experience. Math, computer science, linguistics and so on is more feasible. Also anything that you can analyze old data sets. Stuff like CRISPR is neat too ofc; bioinformatics may be feasible, but still has some paywall journals.
Ideally there would be PhDs willing to volunteer small amounts of time for such things, but they are pretty damn busy people. Not too many PhDs hanging out on IRC and mentoring hobbyists (at least that I can find).
All in all the actual (paid) market for doing research is oversaturated anyway. But I admit there's an appeal to doing that sort of work. OTOH, it's nice to get paid and grad studies have an awful track record for mental health.
Edit: OTOH, it's not that hard to get in touch with PhDs. If you have a draft of a paper you can email it around (probably looking like an idiot, but hey). A fair number of researchers seem to be in my personal proximity at any given time, but I think that has more to do with me than anything else haha.

[–]shred_wizard 2 points 13 days ago 
Yes and no. for example in finance, most of what you learn is self-taught and learned on the job. But the formal education makes a huge difference (helps you identify which models aren't relevant in what situations, makes you better at identifying red flags from an early stage, teaches risk management skills that you wouldn't even bother self-teaching etc.)

[–]gettingthereisfun 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm an accountant so I hear you. You need a formal education with some guidance for sure. Same in STEM fields and basically every profession. But the majority of my life as an accountant I'm going to need to keep learning new treatments and best practices that nobody but me will teach me. And I need continuing education credits to keep my cpa license. So self directed learning is a big part of my life.

Yeah duh, that's why I said do something practical to get a job. You don't have to work in a field that you are interested in.
You can have the deepest passion for religious studies and excel in your program, that doesn't mean the job market is great for you.
Now you could keep you passion for religious studies, gain the same knowledge on your own schedule, but at the same time persue a degree in a practical field. When you graduate you can get a solid job, work your job for pay like a grown up, and satisfy your passion another way.
Telling young students to do what they love in post secondary is just setting them up to fail.

A lot of higher education can't be done over the web though. Universities need physical labs to conduct research and provide areas to expose students to tools they wouldn't have access to if everything was virtual.

[–]syr_ark 2 points 13 days ago 
Yeah I can certainly imagine more lectures and even course work being completed and / or delivered via virtual reality / virtual presence, but that won't entirely solve the need for or benefits of a brick and mortar campus and in person interaction.

I don't think it's good to teach every single student in the university the exact same lecture on a topic. No lecture has complete coverage, so you're going to end up with intellectual holes. Khan Academy is great, but their videos tend to have very narrow focus with little overall synthesis, and that's a big part of any university.
Khan is a side dish, not a main course.

[–]StressOverStrain 2 points 13 days ago 
That's why there's this great thing called a textbook, which your instructor usually assigns readings out of. If you actually read it, you'll find a rather comprehensive covering of the course material.
Of course, people are lazy as fuck and can't be bothered to actually learn anything, so hence the prevalence of heavily question-specific targeted videos that teach you how to solve a problem and little of the underlying theory.

[–]TehFence 11 points 13 days ago 
Universities are there for way more things than teaching stuff. That's at most half their job. Research should always be a big part of it, too. So it's not only a school, but a work environmental for many people. And in that regard, being physically separated can often be detrimental. Some of the beat ideas happen in the break room, after all.
And besides that, while that might not be much of a factor when you already have a degree, University is also about more than just learning your topic for the students. It's about the life experience, being in your own, managing your own work, but also working together with other people. That's just not the same if you're just sitting at home.

[–]The_Celtic_Chemist 3 points 13 days ago

[–]pragmatic12 1 point 13 days ago 
I personally don't really like khan academy. Their piece meal material generally only covers the bare minimum of a subject. The material only covers the superficial algorithm in terms of solving a set of problems. Algorithms help speed up the process but it's not inclusive in terms of actually understanding something. It's the difference between a computer scientist and a code monkey. re-purposing is not the same as really understanding the underlying concept. software code isn't just about the code but the underlying math concepts that make the whole thing work. There is the syntax and then there is also the math concepts that support it.
This is my personal opinion, but i'm also curious what other people think about this. You might understand my perspective better if you try to solve one of these problems.

If Google wants to revolutionize education, they could do far more good by popularizing and legitimizing an alternative model of education like Khan. Something that is more democratic and open, and doesn't put its students into decades of debt.
Imagine how much good they could do for the world if they could provide a quality education to rival Stanford's at a fraction of the cost. Or even just a regular, decent state school.
I know they're controversial, but I think the boot camp model of CS education could be the way of the future. They just need some refinement and some legitimization. I could see 1-2 year long boot camps becoming a substitute for a 4 year degree in the future.

[–]corinthian_llama 2 points 13 days ago 
Google is interested in more than CS. They know people need to be widely curious.

[–]why_grapefruit_why 125 points 14 days ago 
Google actually has a close working relationship with Cornell University's graduate tech program in NYC. Cornell Tech students attend classes in Google's building in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan and there are plans for a shared prototype campus on Roosevelt Island. Should be an interesting development.

[–]stml 47 points 13 days ago 
I doubt any of the tech companies in Silicon Valley are really in need of a university. There's Stanford and UC Berkeley right there plus Apple hires more employees from San Jose State University than any other college.
East coast also has plenty of excellent computer science schools. The US upper education system is top tier and doesn't really have a lack of universities for the digital age or whatever stuff this author is on about.

[–]toadofsteel 17 points 13 days ago 
My friend worked at Google for a while after graduating from RIT. Apparently, Google at the time was hiring much more heavily from East Coast colleges than locally.

[–]stml 34 points 13 days ago* 
Well it's just basic math. West Coast only has two truly elite schools for programming and only have a combined enrollment of around 50,000 students at UC Berkeley and Stanford. The East Coast has Harvard, MIT, Carnegie Mellon and a whole host of other schools.
Even then, Stanford and UC Berkeley practically dominate the field for hires in Silicon Valley. The basic proximity to the headquarters also makes it very easy for tech companies to recruit from UC Berkeley and Stanford.

Edit: I should also add Caltech to the list of elite schools. Can't forget them no matter how small they are.

[–]Aerozephr 1 point 13 days ago 
I should have phrased my comment differently, the guy I was replying to said there were only 2 'elite' schools on the west coast so i was reacting to that. I know very little about US colleges

[–]shwinglederp 1 point 13 days ago 
Maybe it's just ignorance on my part, but do entry level positions really need to be filled by students who come from elite universities? If I were trying to get workers who simply needed to get the job done I would look for the most bang for my buck so to speak. Meaning, perhaps I could pay someone who attended a less prestigious university less money. Maybe that's not how it works. But in many cases I seriously doubt the students from those elite schools perform substantially better in entry level positions at tech companies. If anyone has some info on this please inform me.

[–]msixtwofive 1 point 13 days ago 
But in many cases I seriously doubt the students from those elite schools perform substantially better in entry level positions at tech companies.
You're wrong. First of all there's a ton of time and investment companies put into training new employees, turnover ( employees quitting or getting fired ) is a bad thing for companies. So with this problem they try to keep the firing/quitting as low as possible.
The better schools function as a filter for the quality of work and work ethic that can be (reasonably) expected from the employee. The reason for this is because a graduate from a top prestigious university program ( almost always ) had to have top level dedication and willpower to achieve entry and graduation from those same institutions. That's a much better guarantee to an employer of the quality of work they can expect.

[–]thefuturist1337 0 points 13 days ago 
You are correct, that usually isn't how it works. Generally the salaries at these types of companies entry level are all 6 figures or above. It makes sense for these huge tech companies to try to recruit from the good universities.

[–]SuperSonicHEAT 1 point 13 days ago 
University of Washington qualifies as elite, at least in CS if nothing else.

Holy shit, IBM is married to India. When did that happen?

[–]AnotherBlackMan 1 point 13 days ago 
This is completely wrong. On that list for the East Coast, the only noteworthy schools for any kind of STEM is MIT. Nearly EVERY big school in the West is better than them for sciences, save Cornell. All of the UCs have great STEM programs, Colorado, the Arizona schools, Oregon State, University of Washington, Harvey Mudd, and even some of the state schools in California are recruited heavily for tech companies across the country.

[–]dm6 2 points 13 days ago 
STEM is such a huge umbrella term that it's not even worth trying to quantify and compare "STEM programs." In terms of programming and Computer Science, which this sub-thread has delved into, you're "completely wrong" or perhaps just under-informed. For an un-biased source, look to the U.S. News rankings of top grad schools in CS (which often cultivate great undergrads). 7 of the top 25 are on the west coast. From a CS perspective it's well known that the west coast doesn't hold anywhere near a majority of the top schools in CS. New England alone has 6 of the top 25!

[–]AnotherBlackMan 1 point 13 days ago 
Look at the Engineering overall rankings my friend. 4 of the top 10 are in California alone with only 2 schools representing the East Coast.

[–]dm6 1 point 12 days ago* 
Exactly, you proved my point. "STEM programs" is so broad that it's not worth trying to draw comparison on such a nebulous term as the sub-fields can vary in quality wildly amongst schools. And in the case of computer science, as this thread relates to, the claim isn't crazy that a bulk of the top CS schools aren't on the west coast as a previous commenter said.

I think people forget how much apple innovated. Even recently. It's just the style to circle jerk about apple, but the Macintosh, the apple2, the newton, hell even the ipod and iPhone were so far ahead of the game everyone thought they were nuts. "nobody wants an ipod, I can just use my 1gb SanDisk player, no one needs 5gb of music. This is stupid"
Iphone was a huge leap. I looked it up recently, you know what the 3 top phones were the day iPhone was announced? Blackberry Perl, tmobile sidekick, and Motorola razr. They were the hottest phones.
The apple 2 was revolutionary and just miles ahead of what was popular at the time, you remember what was big just before the apple 2? The commodore PET. Remember that? Probably not.

[–]Tiki_Torch 104 points 14 days ago 
Exactly. I'm an iOS developer so I have to hear the anti-Apple circle jerk every single day multiple times a day simply because I have a Mac on my desk.
Just the other day a coworker claimed Apple "stole" the Windows style interface from Microsoft.
When I politely explained how that was incorrect, and how Apple had a GUI before Microsoft, and that Apple was given exclusive access to Xerox's Parc system in exchange for shares which they based their GUI off of (legally, it was the whole idea behind the meeting) I was met with ridicule insinuating that I was being "defensive", acting like a typical "Apple Fanboy" and was told "Fanboys are never wrong."
Incredibly annoying. I work with stupid people.

I don't even usually bother correcting people anymore but it does get exhausting to listen to daily.

This is the first time I've ever heard that demo described that way. You have a reference to back that up?

[–]AfroPhysics 29 points 13 days ago* 
They're likely referencing the notoriously dubious source: mac-history.net. I wouldn't expect them to be impartial, or to be willing to offer even a hint of the truth. The article I linked goes to great lengths to convince the world that Apple didn't steal anything tangible from Xerox -- just all of their conceptual IP, and that's no big deal. Microsoft did the same thing, and they didn't have to pay for it!
I'm not sure why it never occurred to them that simply because Microsoft had connections and was given free access, that it doesn't render that access illegitimate because they didn't pay for it.
There's also zero references in the article for the source of the supposed stock trade. So I guess we're supposed to take the author's word on the facts? Right?
No matter what some fake history site says, Apple stole from Xerox just like everyone else.

[–]qwyxzy 1 point 13 days ago 
Wikipedia:
There is still some controversy over the amount of influence that Xerox's PARC work, as opposed to previous academic research, had on the GUIs of the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, but it is clear that the influence was extensive, because first versions of Lisa GUIs even lacked icons. These prototype GUIs are at least mouse-driven, but completely ignored the WIMP ( "window, icon, menu, pointing device") concept. Screenshots of first GUIs of Apple Lisa prototypes show the early designs. Note also that Apple engineers visited the PARC facilities (Apple secured the rights for the visit by compensating Xerox with a pre-IPO purchase of Apple stock) and a number of PARC employees subsequently moved to Apple to work on the Lisa and Macintosh GUI. However, the Apple work extended PARC's considerably, adding manipulatable icons, and drag&drop manipulation of objects in the file system (see Macintosh Finder) for example. A list of the improvements made by Apple, beyond the PARC interface, can be read at Folklore.org.[9] Jef Raskin warns that many of the reported facts in the history of the PARC and Macintosh development are inaccurate, distorted or even fabricated, due to the lack of usage by historians of direct primary sources.[10]
Interpret this as you will.

[–]AfroPhysics 2 points 13 days ago* 
There's nothing to interpret. It offers no more source details about the supposed stock for IP quid pro quo that is famously used by apologists to somehow legitimize claims about technology espionage.
Early access to pre-IPO stock is called an investment and Xerox had deep pockets so it's fitting and imo more plausible than the other.

[–]Tiki_Torch 2 points 13 days ago 
I honestly don't remember where I read or heard it but this article sums up most of what I remember. Xerox got 100,000 shares of Apple stock in exchange for Jobs and his team being allowed to see PARC:
http://zurb.com/article/801/steve-jobs-and-xerox-the-truth-about-inno

[–]redwall_hp -1 points 13 days ago 
Wikipedia? Apple was given access to the Alto, which PARC considered a dead end proof of concept, in exchange for some pre-IPO Apple stock.
It's also worth noting that the Alto bears little resemblance to the Mac. It did windowing, and that's about it. There was no drag and drop, no file manager like the Mac's finder, concepts like the menu bar and trash were nonexistent, etc.. Anyone who references "stealing" in regards to PARC really doesn't know what they're talking about. Especially the "Microsoft also got it off PARC" people, given the complete dissimilarity between the Alto and the Macintosh system...which Microsoft was later sued for copying.

[–]andrewpolidori 4 points 13 days ago 
Just to be clear, Microsoft won that suit and was found to not be infringing.

[–]redwall_hp -1 points 13 days ago 
Nope. They settled. You know that $100 million or whatever that people bandy about as Microsoft "saving" Apple? That was a court settlement.

[–]andrewpolidori 2 points 13 days ago 
After the district court ruled in favor of Microsoft, Apple appealed the decision arguing that the district court only considered infringements on the individual elements of Apple's GUI, rather than the interface as a whole. The appeals court almost entirely affirmed the ruling of the district court, establishing that, "almost all the similarities spring either from the license or from basic ideas and their obvious expression... illicit copying could occur only if the works as a whole are virtually identical."[2] However, the circuit court did reverse the district court's decision not to award attorney's fees to Microsoft, clarifying and sending the case back to the district court to resolve the issue.
So not only did Microsoft win, Apples appeal was entirely fruitless even resulting in Microsoft getting their attorney's fees paid for.
In 1997, three years after the lawsuit was decided, all lingering infringement questions against Microsoft regarding the Lisa and Macintosh GUI as well as Apple's "QuickTime piracy" lawsuit against Microsoft were settled in direct negotiations. Apple agreed to make Internet Explorer their default browser, to the detriment of Netscape. Microsoft agreed to continue developing Microsoft Office and other software for the Mac over the next five years. Microsoft also purchased $150 million of non-voting Apple stock. Both parties entered into a patent cross-licensing agreement.[11][12]
Companies negotiate all the time, but those happened well after MS had already won in court. Apple no doubt agreed to settle because that cash infusion was in their interest, given that they were haemorrhaging money badly. So that money was in fact a saving grace. Source

[–]maca77aq 9 points 13 days ago 
Next time someone bitches, point them to this licensing case: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp.
MS had licensed the GUI from Apple, and the only reason MS was able to keep using it is because a court said so.

[–]Impact009 20 points 13 days ago 
The court ruled that, "Apple cannot get patent-like protection for the idea of a graphical user interface, or the idea of a desktop metaphor [under copyright law]...".[2]
The majority of the hatred that I see against Apple stems from them trying to inhibit technological growth that's not through them, and your source highlights that hypocrisy. It's one thing to build off of other people's work, that's just technological development, but things like acting like they invented the concept of a GUI when they didn't makes it difficult for people to like them, and "fanboys" are blind to this.
The very laws that Apple has been trying to push for would have been the very same laws that would have stopped their growth in the past.

[–]Yep_its_A 2 points 13 days ago 
I still hate apple mostly because you have to have a mac if you want to develop. Ohh you want to make an app for your iphone better go buy a Mac. It's Stupid and thats why I hate them. Its small reason but I should be able to develop an app for my phone and not have to have stupid Mac to simply write and push code to apple. This is why my iPhone was the 1st and last apple product...

[–]Tiki_Torch -1 points 13 days ago* 
Windows is the same way. Development environments are very tightly integrated into the OS which is why you don't see Visual Studio on a Mac, it depends far too much on Windows frameworks just like Xcode relies on Apples frameworks.
EDIT: I'm not wrong. Down voting is perpetuating that what I'm saying is incorrect. Some people may find this knowledge useful.

[–]Jushak 2 points 13 days ago 
Except that you can program for iOS on Windows. You just can't get it to work without using a Mac to sign the damn thing before you can run it on iOS phone.

[–]Tiki_Torch 0 points 13 days ago* 
Not really.
You have no access to interface builder, storyboards, entitlements, keychain (needed for code signing), or the simulator.
You may be able to use a crappy third party tool like Phonegap or a game engine like Unity but for a straight up application you won't have access to the stuff you need.
Not to mention there are thousands of APIs that come along with Xcode. You'd need to grab all of the code files for those.
EDIT: It's hilarious this is down voted. I'm not wrong.

And Apple sued MS because they infringed on the desktop GUI that MS was wanted to use for Windows (to make it better). How does Apple patent a desktop metaphor? Apple are a bunch of pricks. Your co-worker was right.

[–]Tiki_Torch 1 point 13 days ago 
No he isn't. What part of your statement (which by the way isn't 100% correct) is Apple stealing Microsofts "Windows style interface"?
Also from the lawsuit:
"Apple had agreed to license certain parts of its GUI to Microsoft for use in Windows 1.0, but when Microsoft made changes in Windows 2.0 adding overlapping windows and other features found in the Macintosh GUI, Apple filed suit. Apple added additional claims to the suit when Microsoft released Windows 3.0.[5][6]"

[–]boytjie 1 point 13 days ago 
Apple stealing Microsofts "Windows style interface"?
Read it again. I didn’t say Apple was stealing the interface (Apple was 1st with the GUI on the Macintosh). They were just getting all litigious when MS wanted to use the desktop metaphor as if office procedure was patent-able. Apparently it is.

When people ask why I use a Macbook I say "Because I like it and it was worth the money to me," don't see why it needs to go any further than that. As a computer science student I probably know more about how my computer works than the average anti-Apple circle jerker anyway.

*Not even kidding, they think that you're supposed to put everything in the root of C instead of their profile folder despite me telling them if they need a profile transfer that stuff won't be transferred because IT won't look for it.

About a month ago I was hanging out with friends. I took some nice slowmo on my iphone. One of my friends loved the phone and was super impressed with the slowmo. Then she excitedly asked what type of phone I had, then I said "iPhone." And instinctively she backpedaled and said "oh uhh never mind I don't like that video. Fuck that phone."
Like the picture or video is either good or not. Doesn't matter if you shot it on an a7x or a potato from 1352 AD. But their hate for anything Apple is so strong that they can't realize they're fucking but Android shills, yet only I can be a shill and all I need to do to become one is not hate Apple, but give them a fair assessment. I'm not twisting numbers or stats to make me feel better about my expensive purchase like a shill would do. Idk... It's like they need something to fight for and to believe in. But it's a goddamn phone/OS... It's not debating the origin of physics, matter and humanity.

[–]redwall_hp 1 point 13 days ago 
And the Alto was barely a UI. It was mostly just windowing. A very, very large part of what constitutes modern desktop UI metaphors came directly from Apple...such as the concept of drag and drop.
Then Microsoft not only landed themselves in a lawsuit for cribbing it off them...they actually stole QuickTime code.

That was the entire point of this thread, saying Google has innovated more than Apple. Apple has invented and produced more original products than Google ever has. Saying Apple has not done this is ridiculous. They have been a tech innovator from the beginning. If Apple hasn't invented anything then neither has Microsoft or literally anyone else.

[–]ikahjalmr 0 points 13 days ago 
The point of my comment was to point out to the guy i replied to that the basis of the anti-apple circlejerk is that apple does not invent, they just work with existing things. He made it sound as though there was no sane basis for it

[–]TheKharmeleon[🍰] 1 point 13 days ago* 
There isn't. They have invented things. They just didn't invent the GUI and mouse or the MP3 player, stuff like that, yes, they simply improved an existing idea. It really depends on what you mean by "invent". Going by the definition most people in here are, almost no one has ever invented anything.
That said I would be hard pressed to come up with a google invention or innovation beyond search (which obviously they did not invent). They have contributed a lot to standardizing web technologies though. Oh yeah and they definitely innovated in web ads, but again, they didn't invent online ad networks.

Invention is not limited (in it's definition) to ONLY things that are brand-new and invented from "whole cloth" to a world that's never before seen them.
Taking an existing thing (that's poorly executed) and re-designing it into something that's hugely popular and useful... most definitely IS a type of invention.

[–]ikahjalmr 1 point 13 days ago 
From dictionary.reference.com: 2. U.S. Patent Law. a new, useful process, machine, improvement, etc., that did not exist previously

[–]jmnugent 1 point 13 days ago 
Well.. to be pedantic... if Apple takes an existing product.. and re-designs/re-mixes it into something that "did not exist previously"... then that DOES qualify as "inventing".

[–]ikahjalmr 1 point 13 days ago 
Yes I agree, but the point of the circle jerk is that they didn't invent a touchscreen phone or mp3 player, they were still forms of already existing things

[–]jmnugent 1 point 13 days ago 
Would you say that a multi-tool like a Leatherman or a SOG wasn't "invented" ?... because it doesn't actually contribute any new tools. All of the tools it has existed prior.
But to me.. that's an invention.. because you're creating/combining the components in a new way.

[–]naphini 1 point 13 days ago 
This is so pedantic. No, they did not invent the idea of a touchscreen smart phone whole cloth in 2007. But they invented the iPhone, which was light-years ahead of what anyone else was doing. The anti-Apple circlejerk would have us believe that Apple just plunked down yet another smartphone that was basically the same as everyone else's, only prettier, and beat them with marketing. If you'd seen what smartphones were like before the iPhone, you'd know better.

[–]aYearOfPrompts -1 points 13 days ago 
Apple invents all sorts of things, along with designing and refining. But lets allow numbers to do the talking so our own anecdotal views don't get in the way. If we use patents as an indicator of innovation, and we should, Apple is not significantly far behind Google. In fact, Apple is ahead of Google from 2005-2015.
The real takeaway? Apple, Google, and yes even Microsoft are all innovating at massive speeds.

[–]Jushak 1 point 13 days ago 
Patents? Considering we're talking about Apple, it isn't a sign of innovation. I mean, patenting rounded rectangle? Really, much innovation, so wow...

[–]aYearOfPrompts 1 point 13 days ago 
Thats why you should read the link. It uses patents perceived to have value, not just the total number...

[–]MoatJon- -1 points 13 days ago 
That's not the point of the discussion , you just brought a fact to make apple looks bad, and it's validity is subjective.
For example, I think what you described is also a form of innovation: gathering the right technologies, to create a beautiful product that became revolutionary. Creativity is defined by some as the clever mix of two ideas, and it builds on itself.

[–]Mooskitt 0 points 13 days ago 
They didn't invent them but their own versions were miles and miles ahead of the ones that were invented.. That counts for a lot. Phil Jackson didn't invent the triangle offense but he sure as hell is known for it more than sam barry or tex winter

Marketing is what sets companies apart.

[–]ikahjalmr 3 points 13 days ago 
I agree, I'm just pointing out that the circle jerk is about them not inventing concepts from scratch, which is true

[–]Impact009 2 points 13 days ago 
My Sager (NP8887 I think?) came with an ejectable MP3 player that could support 16 GB of music and is upgradeable.
Early iDevices had terrible battery lives, so while Apple did popularize portable, music storage, it seems like they rushed subpar products out the door just to be "first" while other companies were still R&Ding their products to not have those issues.

[–]GoldenBough 1 point 13 days ago 
Plus iTunes the program plus the iTunes Music store a few years later. Ecosystem counts.

[–]mellokind 1 point 13 days ago* 
The apple 2 was revolutionary and just miles ahead of what was popular at the time, you remember what was big just before the apple 2? The commodore PET.
Not really. The trash 80 was the same or better device (edit: I found a good article that discusses this here) that was released at the same time, and sold a lot more in the beginning and by the very early '80s, there was way more software available for it than the apple or the pet. I had access to all 3, and very much preferred the TRS. And just a year later, the Atari 800 took things to an all new level.
That's a fundamental problem with Apple. It's always "revolutionary" or "innovative" that they use to sell something, and create a false air of exclusivity, when in reality they have always been just following the trends and there were always others doing the same thing. Usually better.

[–]DerNalia 1 point 13 days ago 
Most of that is gone now that Steve Jobs is no longer with us. The whole company needs to recalibrate.

[–]Irythros 1 point 13 days ago 
ipod and iPhone were so far ahead of the game everyone thought they were nuts. "nobody wants an ipod, I can just use my 1gb SanDisk player, no one needs 5gb of music. This is stupid"
In reference to the iPod, no it wasn't even close to being ahead of the game. I had a 32gb samsung with touch control and a screen at the time of the first ipod release for $100 less. The largest iPod I saw at the bestbuy was 8 or 16g for +100 or ~+300

[–]juicyjcantt 1 point 13 days ago 
People forget also the degree to which Apple forced Microsoft to innovate and improve. I mean, go to a Windows store and what do you see - you see some the clean aluminum design on something that looks like a MBP, you see a MB air equivalent, something that looks like a shitty version of the iPhone, and so on. Without Apple - or more specifically, Microsoft and Apple's convoluted history - we'd all be living in a world of dull grey, plasticy boxy stuff and blue screens.
I've used both systems and I prefer Windows, but Windows wouldn't be where it is today, and I probably wouldn't like it today if it wasn't for Apple's influence. The anti-Apple circlejerk really gets out of hand on reddit.

[–]BillJohnStevenson 1 point 13 days ago 
I wouldn't say the iPod was ahead of the game in anything aside from aesthetics.

The Macintosh was a stripped down Xerox Alto. The Apple II was the only one of the '77 trinity that supported colour, thanks to Steve Wozniak, but it also cost almost as much as the other two combined. It was soon matched by the Commodore VIC-20 and the Atari 400. Most people don't even know there was an Apple III. The 6GB Creative NOMAD Jukebox was released a year before the first iPod. I'll give them the iPhone though. Jobs was the first to believe people would buy a phone with no buttons. The LG Prada was released a year earlier. Apple's strength is its cult of personality. People will take a risk on something new if it has an Apple logo on it.

[–]ProtoJazz 1 point 13 days ago 
I agree with most of what your saying, except for comparing the nomad to the ipod. They were pretty different devices aimed at different types of people. The ipod was quite a bit fast though I believe, and may have had better anti skip features. It also quite a bit smaller I believe

[–]Pence128 1 point 13 days ago 
Fair enough. I didn't pay much attention to the early mp3 players. I'm not a huge music lover and they were pretty expensive.

[–][deleted] 23 points 14 days ago 
Apple writes excellent software.

[–]Tuxmascot 21 points 13 days ago 
Writing software is not the same as studying computer science. There are computer scientists who can't code for shit. Computer Science is the study of how computers work and programming is a very small part of that.

[–][deleted] 35 points 13 days ago 
Sure, but implying that Apple has nothing to teach about Computer Science and that they are just a design company is just silly.

[–]Impact009 0 points 13 days ago 
It doesn't make your original point anymore valid. Writing software and computer science are not synonymous. Nobody is arguing against your new point.

[–][deleted] 1 point 13 days ago 
My point is just that Apple would actually be able to produce a very good Computer Science course if they wanted to.
I only talked about their software because that's most of what we see from them in that front, but they also make their own hardware (which has more to do with Computer Engineeeing than CS, but is still important), have some research labs, and are working in some cool new tech like self-driving cars and other unnanounced stuff.

[–]blackedout -1 points 13 days ago 
I think people all will readily admit that Apple is a company (one of a handful) that provide products where the "whole" is greater than the sum of their parts, those same people just forget that those "parts" are also generally better than most other parts out there.

[–]BootyOnRails -4 points 13 days ago 
I wouldn't trust any "computer scientist" who couldn't code for shit. Sure there are a lot of people who specialize in areas like graph theory, machine learning, etc., that don't code in their day to day lives, but I wouldn't trust anyone who can't describe and implement good software architecture and design patterns in a C based language. That's indicative of poor schooling

[–]berrytelly 7 points 13 days ago* 
as a CS undergraduate, i don't know if i can agree with that. being good at actual coding is honestly a different skill set than being good at CS theory. i'm really an average programmer but i've impressed professors before with some unusual code that they would never have thought to use on their own, but i would never claim to be more proficient or knowledgeable than any of them in CS. i think it's reasonable to assert that some people just prefer the theory side of CS better, and so they don't bother honing their coding skills, not that they are incapable of it.

[–]BootyOnRails 1 point 13 days ago 
Sure, that's fair. I'm a current senior in a computer science program, and I think the theory is far more important; I'm not suggesting that a computer scientist has to be well versed in a particular framework or anything like that, as those change on a regular basis. But good coding and good theory go hand in hand. You can certainly specialize in one or the other, but it seems absurd to think someone would go through the schooling required to become a specialist in one without receiving some teaching in the other. The skills are inherently linked. Saying you can have a doctorate and do research in the field of computer science without knowing how to code is like saying you can have a doctorate in some field of mathematics without knowing how to perform basic calculus.

[–]zoinkability -1 points 13 days ago 
Who says computer science is what this proposed university should focus on? The world has lots of top-flight CS programs (Stanford comes to mind). Top-flight HCI programs? Not so many -- and arguably what Apple is best at.

[–]jmnugent 1 point 13 days ago 
I understand this will be viewed as extremely anecdotal... but I work in a corporate environment of several 1000 Windows machines. We have 20 to 30 Macs of a wide diversity (Mac Pros from 2006 to 2010 to 2015, iMacs from 2010 to 2015, Mac Mini's from 2012, Macbook Pros from 2007 to 2011 to 2015, etc. Along with 1000's of iPads and iPhones.
I've worked with every version of OSX since Snow Leopard up through El Capitan... My perception/experience has been pretty smooth. Everything has been seeming to get steadily/incrementally better and easier. Functionality such as joining Macs to the Domain, mapping network-drives, compatibility with other software, etc,etc.. has all seemed to be slowly improving to the point where our Mac users hardly ever call the Helpdesk at all anymore.

[–]ImTakingOverTheWorld 0 points 13 days ago

I mean, it's not the best standalone music player, because it's not a standalone music player. It's leaps and bounds better than Windows Media Player/Center, in UI, speed, and features.

Wait wait, so you know people who continue to use a piece of software they don't like? Why the fuck do you think their opinion is valid😂
And the only reason they continue to use it is because they bought a dumbass iphone
You haven't needed iTunes to use an iPhone for almost half a decade now. Homie, I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Also, look up DoubleTwist for Android. iTunes is so desirable, people hacked it so they could use it with their Androids.
I'm sure you don't know about any of the real killer features of iTunes. #1 is called iTunes Match: $25 a year gives you full amnesty to pirate as much music you want, and get a legit copy of every song added to your library.

[–]screwplease 0 points 13 days ago 
I fix peoples computers, they complain a lot about itunes.
last time I tried to use it was years ago and it was garbage, people still complain about it to me so assume its still garbage.
I have no reason to give it another try, I haven't bought music in probably 15 years.

[–]ImTakingOverTheWorld 1 point 13 days ago

so assume
You know what they say about assuming. Also, these are people who come to you with BROKEN COMPUTERS.
I have no reason to give it another try, I haven't bought music in probably 15 years
So you don't listen to music? Then why does your opinion matter? Or wait, you pirate music? Then iTunes Match would make your illegal music legal.
Ultimately, I just don't think you should talk about a software you haven't tried for years, have no use for, and aren't willing to even consider.

[–]screwplease 1 point 13 days ago 
Eh, I care for your opinion of my opinion probably about as much as you care for mine.
I'll stick to my assumption that itunes is garbage based on the evidence I've seen in the real world over the last 15 years.
Ultimately, it doesn't really matter what you think I should talk about, and I don't plan on asking you for your opinion of my opinion in the future either. If that's ok with you.
But I have enjoyed this exercise in futility.

Why Apple though? Apple is a consumer electronics company that higher 3rd parties to do most of their R&D. They are also highly secretive. They don't push computer science, or even seem to have any interest in advancing certain areas. If there is a so called "hard problem" to solve that they want in their products, they contract 3rd party companies to solve it for them. Not very academic.
Google is one massive research lab that are constantly releasing bulk after bulk of research to the web. Once a product is launched, they are not at all secretive about how things work. They push computer science, making constant major breakthroughs in the field. When there is "hard problems" to solve, they create a new team to tackle that problem and then hire the best from academia to lead them. They are very academic.
There is nothing wrong with the way Apple do things, that's just the way they do things and it works really well for them. But they don't scream "University" to me.

[–]akyser 20 points 13 days ago 
Because this is about what Apple should do with all the money it has. It has $200 BILLION just sitting around. And that's after doing a massive buyback to give it's shareholders another $150 Billion. For context, Google has about $35 Billion on hand. Apple is bigger than Exxon Mobile (4th biggest company in the world) and General Electric (6th biggest company in the world) combined. It's cash on hand is bigger than the whole of Visa, or Coca-Cola, or Walmart. It's quarterly profits are bigger than Google and Microsoft combined. It's just playing on a different level than any other company right now.
So yes, Google totally could build a world class university from scratch. It has the money to do that, in addition to all of the other stuff they're doing. But Apple needs to do something with all this money, more than Google does.

But being secretive about research is more for corporations not colleges which is why Google would be better at this.

Google isn't concerned about creating a country of developers, though. They care about the top 1% of the top 1%, which is why they already partner with Cornell and others who already churn out those people.
Education is a philanthropic undertaking, not a business strategy. It doesn't make sense for Google, Apple, Microsoft, or any other tech company to start a brand new school. It DOES make sense for them to partner with schools as a (possibly very) long-term strategy to cultivate a new generation of customers and a more educated consumer class.

Apple is a consumer electronics company that higher 3rd parties to do most of their R&D.
Where on Earth did you get this idea?
Apple does almost the the entirety of their R&D in house. Had you spent all of thirty seconds Googling some combination of the words "apple" "R&D" and "third party" you'd have quickly realized how wrong you are about this. You would have found articles like "Apple Planning “Cutting-Edge” R&D Facility In Japan", "Apple ramps up R&D spending", and "Apple boosts R&D spending in new product hunt." The notion that Apple outsources their R&D is just flat out wrong.
They don't push computer science...
Again, this is a ridiculous notion. Apple maintains a compiler, a programming language, and a fork of BSD. Apple designed the world's fastest (in terms of single-core performance) ARMv8 processor.
Dislike Apple all you want, but the notion that they're nothing more than "a consumer electronics company that higher 3rd parties to do most of their R&D" is demonstrably false.

Incorrect. Apple designed every single A series processor. Samsung and TSMC just fab them—including the A9X.
Why is it so hard for people to accept that the most successful computer company in the world is actually pretty damn good at making computers?

Where are you getting this? Do you have any examples? They occasionally buy other companies for their software, rather than try to catch up themselves from scratch, which is what they did for iTunes and Siri and Logic, for example. But they bought those companies and folded them into Apple, they didn't hire them as contractors. I can't think of any major product of theirs that was created by a third party. That doesn't seem like Apple's style at all, who, like you said, prefer to keep things secret, and secret necessarily means in-house.

[–]thefroggfather 2 points 13 days ago* 
You've given your own examples, but even touching on one you mention.
Siri. Yes they acquired the app, but even the "heavy" lifting of Siri is done by other people. Nuance is the powerhouse behind their voice recognition, still is today. Apple don't do that in house. Google and others would never do that even after an acquisition, they would do the big data and deep learning themselves. Apple have no interest in doing that if others can do it for them. Nuance is a third party that runs their product.
That doesn't seem like Apple's style at all, who, like you said, prefer to keep things secret, and secret necessarily means in-house.
It's called a confidentiality agreement. Nuance for example, was outed by an Apple employee. You don't fuck around with Apple contracts, you fuck around you go bankrupt.. That's how they are good with secrecy.
I can't think of any major product of theirs that was created by a third party.
Every Major apple product has third party contractors. I'm not saying they don't do anything themselves *. Their OSes for the most part, are theirs. Their UX is 100% theirs, but you don't know *any third party involved in their products? Well now you know one on the software side by your own example, Nuance. Apple didn't want to compete with Google or Microsoft on an A.I level, so they hire Nuance instead to handle that. They didn't acquire nuance, they contract nuance. Apple is a client of Nuance.
On the hardware side of things, almost everything. But even hardware they brand as their own such as the coveted A7 processor that looks like this was actually made by Samsung. Yes, the same samsung they pretend to hate still to this day gets paid every-time someone buys an iPhone. They are what the industry calls "frenemies".
But all of that is ok! There is nothing wrong with Apple doing any of this. They make the most money, their focus is consumer electronics. All they care about is the end result: is the final product they've packaged together from xyz good. And the answer is usually yes. However they don't contribute much to computer science is all I'm saying. Most of the cutting edge research is done by other people. Therefore I found them an odd example. But most importantly, if you diregard everything I said above as its a minor point, they are so closed off about their products, their achievements, and their research. That's what really makes them an odd choice for me.

[–]naphini 2 points 13 days ago 
Okay, thanks for the example, I didn't know about Nuance. Yes, I was just talking about software. I know that Apple doesn't make all its own hardware components (no one does). Although the chip you mentioned is actually designed in-house by Apple, and physically manufactured by Samsung. It's not just a Samsung chip that's been re-branded by Apple.

[–]thefroggfather 2 points 13 days ago

Apple have RnD facilities for 13,000 people completed this year
Google have pulled back their 20% blue sky thinking time for their employees
Apple does have Bluesky - a few weeks for certain employees to do their own thing
A university is not primarily for research. It is mainly to train people.
If anyone thinks that having a few thousand students being trained in computing and business on the doorstep to their RnD research center or head office is a bad idea I don't know why. It makes no sense to me. Whether Google should do it or not is not relevant to Apple strategy.

[–]Dinkelbert 5 points 13 days ago 
But while Steve Jobs was a founder and most importantly very wealthy thanks to Apple, Tim Cook is only CEO. This does not make him an important owner of Apple stock (he will probably have Apple stock, but it's not like he is a co-founder).
So, the $200 Billion Apple has lying around is by no means Tim Cook's money. And I bet Tim Cook does not have that much money to begin with (compared to Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg, Brin, Page etc.).

http://northcarolina.edu/?q=news/2015/02/impact-higher-education-nc-totaled-635-billion-2012-13
North Carolina’s institutions of higher education deliver a solid return on investment for their students and the state, according to the first-ever statewide analysis of higher education’s impact on the state’s economy. The University of North Carolina system, the North Carolina Community College System and the 36 campuses of North Carolina Independent Colleges and Universities in the state together created $63.5 billion in added economic value during fiscal year 2012-13, finds the study conducted by Economic Modeling Specialists International (EMSI).
The study also finds that while taxpayers invested $4.3 billion to support higher education in North Carolina during fiscal year 2012-13, the return on that investment totaled $17 billion.
Higher education is a key economic driver in North Carolina, the study found, with business and industry relying on the state’s education institutions to produce skilled employees and foster innovation and entrepreneurship. North Carolina colleges and universities also generate strong returns on investment for students, who benefit from higher lifetime earnings, and communities across the state, which realize societal savings, according to the study.
http://www.ncicu.org/who_pub.html
As a whole, $8.9 billion was spent on education at NCICU campuses in FY 2012-13. This includes $7.2 billion in expenses by the institutions, $94 million in student expenses, and $1.6 billion in student opportunity costs. In return, the state of North Carolina will receive a present value of $28.8 billion in added state income over the course of the students’ working lives. North Carolina will also benefit from $3.4 billion in present value social savings related to reduced crime, lower welfare and unemployment, and increased health and well-being across the state. For every dollar society invests in an education from the NCICU institutions, an average of $3.60 in benefits will accrue to North Carolina over the course of the students’ careers.

They fund the students (generally on expectation that the student returns to work for them) and maybe some specific research programs in their area of interest but almost never directly fund the Universities. This would be a large conflict of interest and generally would be against the mission of most Universities, who should not be beholden to corporate interests. Almost all donations come from individuals. I'd imagine most corporate shareholders would reject the idea of just giving money away to a university as well.
If you have an example of an industry donating to a top-tier university I'd like to see it.

Then shouldn't the government, not corporations, be paying people to go to college?
Also, if people were paid to go to college, it would remove a justification used for college graduates having higher wages.
Essentially, people do have their college paid for and get paid to go to college - it's just that this payout happens after they've graduated.
College graduates on average earn more than non-graduates over their lifetime.

[–]studiedphilosophy 14 points 13 days ago 
couple of things:
a) there is absolutely nothing ironic about that statement b) Tim Cook is not worth a couple of billion dollars c) the couple of billion dollars you want him to give to Duke doesn't belong to him; it belongs to Apple shareholders. They've trusted him with it under the implicit promise that he will invest it on their behalf and achieve a better return than they could elsewhere for the same risk profile. Anything less, much less donating it to charity, would be grounds for the BODs to fire him, given that they have a fiduciary duty to shareholders, aka owners of the company.

[–]LoganDay157 1 point 13 days ago

MOOC coursework will not be widely accepted until MOOCs provide quality that is comparable to regular university courses. I've looked at a lot of MOOCs from all the major providers. I have yet to see one that can provide me with a similar level of education I would get in a classroom.
The biggest problem I see with MOOCs is that they don't have any high quality textbooks to use so you end up just getting a watered down version of the subject or just learning the basics.
I think MOOCs are the wave of the future but they still have a lot to improve on. MOOCs won't be taken seriously until we see students who have taken a MOOC outperforming students who have taken a regular college class.

A non-profit has no shareholders, so there's nobody to make a profit. An employee of a non-profit can be well-paid and a non-profit can definitely make more revenue than it spends, but since nobody owns a non-profit, there's no profit potential for ownership

A few years ago, a group tried to take over the Sierra Club by organizing votes. There are similarities between voting members of a non-profit and voting shareholders of a for-profit corp.

[–]bingosherlock 1 point 13 days ago 
yes, however, the key distinction I think that you're missing here is that members and board members have no direct claim to the assets or excess revenues of a non-profit because they do not own it. from a governance standpoint there are similarities between these roles and shareholders, but from a claim to ownership (and, by extension, profit) there are no such similaritites

[–]Detaineee 1 point 13 days ago 
Oh I see what you are saying. That's true. Probably the closest most legitimate nonprofits come to crossing that line is when they pay their CEOs excessive salaries.

But shareholders wouldn't sue if Google takes a huge chunk of capital and says "this part is non-profit now"?

[–]PM_ME_UR_REDDIT_GOLD 2 points 13 days ago* 
in practice it is virtually impossible for shareholders to get a judgement against corporate executives unless those executives committed actual fraud.
So long as some "this is in Google's best interest" type argument can be made, even if the argument is a poor one, the suit would fail. The idea that companies are required to maximize profit all the time is a pretty new one, and is not really reflected by the law. Executives have near complete discretion when it comes to determining what is best for the company, so voting in a Board that will sack them is the only real remedy.

[–]rs039 2 points 13 days ago 
Understood and agreed, but I think that if Google chartered a completely separate entity, designated it as a non-profit, and endowed it with the billions of dollars required to make it an MIT-competitor, that would be an interesting case.

[–]Detaineee 0 points 14 days ago 
Most of the voting shares are owned by Googlers (mostly Brin and Page) and so it would be weird for them to sue themselves.
The public owns the non-voting class C shares and they have no voting rights and so have little basis to sue. As long as Brin and Page don't do something they said they wouldn't do, they are going to be fine.

[–]logged_n_2_say 6 points 14 days ago* 
majority voting shareholder doesnt dictate who can sue. the owner of a single non-voting share could sue.
but here's breakdown of largest owners: https://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=GOOG+Major+Holders

ninja edit: added "voting" "non-voting"

[–]Detaineee 1 point 13 days ago 
It's much harder for non-voting shareholders to sue only because the voting members set the agenda for the company. If you don't like the agenda, about all you can do is sell. You can sue if you think the change was made to hurt you, but good luck with that.

[–]rs039 1 point 14 days ago

What's wrong with MIT or Stanford or UC Berkeley? Those schools already ARE amazing. Why would people think a corporate created university would be able to function more ethically or morally than Stanford or Harvard? Nearly every university already teaches ethics and has values that it installs in its students.
The universities that came before were created by the personal fortunes of wealthy businessmen. If Mark Zuckerberg wanted to create a Zuckerberg University then fine, but a Google or Facebook University just sounds idiotic and open to so many conflicts of interests. It's not Standard Oil University or Carnegie Steel University, but Carnegie Mellon University and University of Chicago and Rockefeller University.

[–]pcofo 21 points 14 days ago 
Apple actually already has an internal program for some of its execs and aspiring execs called Apple University. Steve Jobs partnered with Wharton to design the program which basically takes a bunch of case studies over Apple's history and shows the execs how and why Apple made the decisions it did. It's an interesting program, and apparently successful though we don't hear much about it.
I think Apple partnering with other universities to update and redesign their curricula to be more high tech and empathy-user oriented could be pretty interesting, but no way do I see them applying the huge amount of effort required to found their own institution.
Agree with other posters, makes much more sense for Google to do something like this especially with their collaborative rather than competitive ethos. Their mountain view campus is pretty similar to a college campus anyways, may just be like opening a new office for them.

[–]Herokumachu 2 points 13 days ago

[–]cvessar 5 points 14 days ago 
I think about this often. There are so many inefficiencies in the way college and late high school works, particularly for stem majors. I would love for a new university or school like thing that took a fresh approach to how to teach students in highly technical majors. I don't really know how a new format would look, but I think a more dynamic method of changing the system after each class would be a good start.

[–]phatdoge 12 points 14 days ago 
Microsoft headquarters has a major research university practically down the the street from them (University of Washington main campus). Over the years they've donated a good amount to the Computer Sciences department. They've also given money to other institutions.
They have also complained pretty regularly that there are not enough college educated and/or technically trained people locally, or even in the US, for them to hire.
I'm always left with the thought, "But your company could easily fix that. You are an established part of the system. You can affect the number of people being educated and the way they are being trained with a single phone call. Plus you own Microsoft Virtual Academy. What's the problem here?"

[–]rukqoa 1 point 13 days ago 
That's because people who graduate from the UW CSE program don't necessarily want to work for microsoft when they have a million other options. Microsoft is an aging company. The field is incredibly meritocracy-like and many young engineers don't like companies where there are a bunch of people there who occupy positions of power just because they've been there for a while. There could be 10x the amount of CS graduates and they would still complain about roughly the same thing.

[–]boytjie 3 points 13 days ago 
Lectures are so useless
Virginia Woolf thinks so too.
“University lectures are an obsolete practice inherited from the Middle Ages when books were scarce. Students should read, not listen. To swallow instruction from a lectern is like sipping English literature through a straw. Lectures pander to the vanity of the lecturer and stimulate conflict between academics.”
Virgina Woolf –

[–]jayrandez 13 points 14 days ago

It's a trade-off between big money (relevant) or clueless ivy league academics (irrelevant).

[–]Terminal-Psychosis 1 point 11 days ago 
clueless ivy league academics

big money
There is a trade-off, but we loose out on the deal, not win.

[–]boytjie 1 point 11 days ago 
I was speaking loosely. It’s a trade-off between bad and worse. It also depends on what is considered a ‘win’. If big money and industry define the curriculum, graduates will be more suited to the workplace but will be dysfunctional in other areas (this was my, loosely speaking, ‘win’).
If Ivy League academics define the curriculum, technology will be short but other disciplines like classics, philosophy, languages, etc will be included which industry considers irrelevant. These disciplines do (IMO) make for a more well-rounded graduate but they do not have profit potential so industry would consider them irrelevant. Industry is only concerned with the money-making potential of graduates – not the ‘well rounded’ nature. It depends on what is considered the ‘ideal profile’ of graduates and (IMO) well rounded is not a bad thing. In the predatory world of commerce, making money trumps ‘well rounded’. Thus a ‘win’.

[–]Terminal-Psychosis 1 point 11 days ago 
If big money and industry define the curriculum, graduates will be more suited to the workplace
"The workplace", industries that buy off school policies, and entire swaths of laws for their benefit.
This is a plus for them, not in any way students or workers.
If Ivy League academics define the curriculum
That is the thing. They do not. The people defining the curriculum, like said above, are the shareholders and donators to the school. Also, government laws the school is forced to follow, bought by the same industries.
This is all bad for students and future employees, for advancement of science, art and society as a whole.
I believe education should be about education, not maximizing profits for the benefit of large industries. The little guy here, all of us are being abused. "Well rounded" provides the knowledge and wisdom to work for yourself. Concentrating on a narrow curriculum dictated by industries hinders personal choice.
I say again, this is highly profitable for corporations, and all bad for the individual.

[–]boytjie 1 point 11 days ago 
I say again, this is highly profitable for corporations, and all bad for the individual.
You are probably right (I’m not American). Pragmatism is advised. If money comes from industry and the institution is constrained by law, the institution must do as it’s told (even if it’s ‘bad’ for the individual).
Anyway, “bad for the individual” would be contested. The individual makes money and their peer group is homogenous. None of them know that life is more than following the dictates of industry and making money. What you don’t know, you can’t miss.
So ‘bad for the individual’ is only true in a universal sense. In an incestuous environment, no one knows any different. If this attitude is reinforced by being indoctrinated to regard anything non-American as inferior, the US shoots itself in the foot.

[–]Terminal-Psychosis 1 point 11 days ago 
None of them know that life is more than following the dictates of industry and making money. What you don’t know, you can’t miss.
You make a good point, which is why letting insanely wealthy concerns (business) have control of our learning (from 1st grade to university) is a BAD idea.
Even if this individual is not aware they could have better, they could. The companies, universities, and governments abusing these individuals know full well what they are doing.
So ‘bad for the individual’ is only true in a universal sense.
I completely disagree. It is bad for everyone. The entire planet, as well as each of us. You, me, our families, neighborhoods, countries.
The only people it is good for is the insanely tiny minority that in control of the vast majority our (everyone on planet Earth's) global resources.
Humans cannot be allowed to train other humans like this. Actively working to keep children ignorant is a detestable thing in my eyes.

[–]boytjie 1 point 10 days ago

I agree, it is a bad idea. But this is the way the American system works. The people with the money, call the shots.
I completely disagree. It is bad for everyone.
Yup. If the US was insular and graduates only had contact with one another, shortcomings in education would never be obvious. Bad for the individual in a universal sense means if the graduate has contact with the rest of the world (universal in this context means everyone else).
Actively working to keep children ignorant is a detestable thing in my eyes.
I agree again but what can you do?

[–]Terminal-Psychosis 1 point 10 days ago* 
Ahh ok, we agree much more than I originally thought.
Now I see your point.
What can we do? In America, the very first thing is to get Big Money out of politics. Before that, not much else is possible.
One solution is bringing back the secret ballot, so the people (now legally) bribing our politicians are denied proof of the return on their investment.
We desperately need campaign reform too, and overturning the ridiculous idea that money is "free speech" and corporations = citizens.
This will help schools get the power back to start teaching and learning actual facts again, instead of corporate-driven mumbo-jumbo.
Through the rest of the world, it looks pretty much the same. get money out of politics.

[–]boytjie 2 points 10 days ago 
Your solutions are impossibly idealistic and are unlikely to ever be implemented. I have a solution that is even more impossibly idealistic and less likely to be implemented – Global VR schools
Even present day VR should be adequate for VR schools. If the hype surrounding software like 2nd Life is true, it shouldn’t be too difficult (in the technical sense). It just takes political will and planning.
Picture it:
An internet site exists devoted to VR schooling. All VR schools are listed with hyperlinks taking you to the ‘campus’. All lessons are modular so that when the student is constructing a curriculum, they might have a module on Chinese History (for eg.) taught out of China. Or a technical subject taught out of America (the US may have shortcomings in some areas of education but technically they are 1st class). I suspect that they are distinctly non-shabby in business subjects as well. Europe will do Western classics and philosophy. China and Asia will squabble over their versions. Russia will weigh-in. It doesn’t matter because all modules can be represented – market forces will determine success. Religious instruction will be contentious with Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, etc. competing. The student chooses.
A student (anywhere in the world) registers for the courses they wish to take. They construct their avatar, select their username and get it approved by the school. The school sells the student the necessary interface (probably a headset with lip mike) and biometric gear (student ID is important) adequate for school issues. Biometric gear is to verify identities and suchlike for exams etc. This is a once of cost to the student (it lasts their whole school career and won’t be outrageously expensive). It won’t be much more expensive than the text books. The student manifests each day at school, goes on virtual field trips anywhere in the world with their class and teacher. There are virtual blackboards, laboratories’ (chemistry, physics and IT), etc. Dangerous or expensive experiments can be carried out (there’s no risk). Go on guided tours through nuclear reactors or watch life-size chemical reactions take place. There are huge spaces for debate (modelled on the Greek Athenian forum?) etc. Power is restored to the teacher. Teachers can just mute or eject troublesome avatars (discipline will improve). If a student feels they are been treated unfairly, they can appeal and a recording of the class session can be reviewed. Three strikes against you and you are expelled. A higher appeal is available, but it will take a single adverse judgement and you’re expelled.
It won’t happen of course. But if you’re going to postulate an unlikely scenario, so can I.

Here's my problem with this: IMO brink-and-mortar universities are antiquated. There's already more of them than we need, and it's an inefficient system of learning (and far too costly).
Apple or Google or one of them should just instead have a learning gateway. Start with free books, software, videos, and eventually move into original content. Give people a path to learn anything they want, develop a good evaluation and certification procedure, and over time it can gain more and more credibility with employers and other universities.
MIT already offers ridiculous amounts of free coursework, and now they just started offering a path to some credit (A 'mini-masters'). I think the near future is (or at least should be) a good fraction of college students getting their college education online, for way cheaper than the $200,000 it costs to go to a traditional university. The tipping point it the point where a degree from MIT open courses or 'Apple online university' or whatever starts to get more respect than C-level universities. Then C-level universities stop having a reason to exist, and everyone except professors and administration can go yay.

[–]MysterVaper 2 points 13 days ago 
Not needed. It sounds like an awesome idea that really had impact when they did it...but it wouldn't resound with the same importance or utility today.
Universities are knowledge repositories. At their essence universities are designed to disseminate knowledge amongst some in the populace. We won't need that in the future, in fact universities now are being replaced by their new versions but we haven't fully grabbed ahold as a society not the new wave of higher education: free online colleges.
Why staff a university with professors and staff (all with their own views and politics) when you can assemble all the information for every course and align it to your personal view before you ever hit "publish"? As long as the same information is made available for free on the internet universities will feel the bite of "near-zero marginal cost".
One day soon we will all realize it is only the information that matters, not the status or social credit a term at university provides.

[–]InequalityCreatesJob 8 points 13 days ago 
Apple. A company that has innovated little of value since the iPhone almost ten years ago. A company that relies on production on a plant with so horrible work they have suicide nets. Has around 90% of its revenue abroad to avoid paying taxes, uses only 2% of its revenue on research and development. Used more money to buy BEATS than R&D. Yeah, these guys are going to selflessly invest in the future of American citizens.

No, because the concept of universities is outdated.
With the same money you could invest in open learning for all, or maybe even open the door to decentralized certification, so that universities can stop screwing people who are stuck holding all their credits in one location.

[–]Megalovania 1 point 14 days ago 
I think the education system needs to be rebuilt from scratch. I wish I could've gone to school to actually learn meaningful and impactful things, but the reality of it stands that I went to University to get a Degree -- Everything else was secondary. My degree got me my job, but for the most part I'd estimate 75% of my education was wasted with useless, non-applicable information. I went in for Computer Science, mind you.

[–]life-is-fubar 1 point 13 days ago* 
Don't blame the school; blame the employers for basically requiring applicants to have X degree to simply walk in the door. There are plenty of trade schools that offer an Associate's degree or certification in a given field, but employers will always prefer to interview the candidate with a Bachelor's degree, even if they have less expertise.
It's all fucked.
I went to a two-year school and got an Associate's before transferring to a four-year school for a Bachelor's. The program at the two-year school was incredibly more focused and in-depth than the four-year school. I learned almost nothing more in those last two years, other than how much irrelevant shit I have to drag my feet through to get a degree.

Actually Apple is one of the only companies who refuse to work with manufacturers found to be using child labour, and they send inspectors round the factories. There are even some that employ children but not on the Apple lines as they do not wish to lose the contract.

"Never donates to charities" tells me right off the bat you have no clue what you're talking about. Product Red is most notable, not to mention and time a disaster hits, open up iTunes and theres a donate button.
Apple has tons of charitable giving too it's just not publicized for profit like most companies do. (You know, the kind that donate a million dollars and spend 10 million telling people about it?)
"Enslavement of children to build their phones". Foxconn employees are willing. Apple doesn't own Foxconn. Every electronic you own from any company has components from Foxconn. If you're so much against it stop using all electronics.

Soon we'll have neural implants. I'll be buying some dodgy freeware shit thank you, not installing GoogleMind or iThink.

[–]goocy 11 points 14 days ago 
Neuroscientist here: no we won't, not even in the lab for another 40 years, even assuming exponential progress. There are so many barriers yet to solve, it can't be done with a single breakthrough. The biggest problem is the unsolved neural coding theory, i.e. even if we can listen to neurons, we don't know what they're talking about.

[–]Winterplatypus 1 point 14 days ago 
Is it possible for current technology to parrot back (mimic & playback) what the neurons are doing without worrying about what the neurons are actually saying?

[–]goocy 2 points 13 days ago 
Yes... in a way. You can either tap a handful of neurons by sticking a microscopic needle into them, or select a couple of millions at once by pushing or measuring an electrical current. The problem with the first method is that individual neurons are really dumb, and the problem with the second is that all the individual signals are mixed with each other. Why, what's your idea?
Generally, you can "activate" neuron groups by pushing a high frequency, and "stun" them with a low frequency. That's used with Parkinson patients, to stop their constant shivering.
You can even connect similar neuron groups between two brains with a cable, and they understand each other.

[–]Winterplatypus 1 point 13 days ago 
I was just wondering what a person would perceive if you could hit them with exactly whatever their neurons were doing from 10 seconds ago. If it did anything interesting or useful you could record what neurons were doing then let someone play back that activity whenever they wanted.

[–]goocy 2 points 13 days ago 
This would feel like a literal time machine. You'd see, hear, think and feel the exact same thing you did before. You wouldn't know that it's an illusion, or even realize that you were making a time jump. Reality just changes to an earlier version, and because it's a forced state of mind, your memories of the "future" aren't allowed to contribute.
That said, it's still technically impossible today to build such a device. Carefully estimating, the brain produces 3-4 terabytes per second. That's about as much bandwidth as South America's combined internet traffic. There is only one device on earth that comes close to that output, and it's the large hadron collider. They use hundreds of thousands of computers just to compress that data quickly enough to write it to disk. But they actually know what their data means, which is crucial for compression. Because we don't know what neuronal signals mean, we need to transmit and store the full output somehow. But for getting these signals in the first place, we'd need ultra-high-throughput wireless nano-sensors that somehow attach to every neuron. That's not happening any time soon either.

The closest thing to a neural implant we have today are cochlear and retinal implants. You do get an input jack for them, and cochlear implants even work with Bluetooth. But I wouldn't recommend either unless you're blind or deaf, because the sensory quality is pretty crappy.

[–]goocy 4 points 14 days ago 
Actually, that's my childhood dream, but I'm in the process of leaving (fundamental) science for good. It's horribly underfunded, needlessly stressful and the career path is a straight line without options or branches.
Even if I don't fall off this line, I'd have to change positions (and move) every two years well into my mid-40s, work long hours, get paid about $30k for that, and spend only about 20% of my time with research. In the words of Piet Borst, "Not the good ones stay in science. The crazy ones do."

Wouldn't that be improved by having a university backed by an investor with deep pockets and the proper agenda? Like Apple or Google? I'm just saying...

[–]goocy 1 point 13 days ago 
In principle, of course. But it's been quite a few decades since private companies funded fundamental research. I'm not expecting any miracles any time soon. Fundamental research is unpopular in the industry, because the applications are always at least 5 years away when you start a new project. Unless you have a very clear vision, you're not going to fund that.

That's not how it works these days. Modern billionaires give their money to "charity" by putting it into a trust that they control and hand over to their children.

[–]patternfall 13 points 14 days ago 
Putting money into a trust you have an interest in isn't a charitable gift by any standard, including the IRS.

Nobody thinks transferring money into a trust the person has an interest in is charity... Unless they don't know how trusts work, I guess.

I feel that if this were to happen with any modern tech company, it would likely not be a university in the traditional sense. It'd likely be closer to a system that the Open university has and what MIT has done with their Open Courseware program. Physical universities are just too damn expensive for many people and the one of the reasons why people enroll for them (and the reason why I'm enrolled in one) is for the more formal structured atmosphere. If they could replicate that without having to actually build a school, it could be very interesting.

Steve Jobs on education and tech companies from a Wired interview in 1996:
Could technology help by improving education?
Jobs: I used to think that technology could help education. I've probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I've had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What's wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.
It's a political problem. The problems are sociopolitical. The problems are unions. You plot the growth of the NEA [National Education Association] and the dropping of SAT scores, and they're inversely proportional. The problems are unions in the schools. The problem is bureaucracy. I'm one of these people who believes the best thing we could ever do is go to the full voucher system.
I have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years before high school. This private school is the best school I've seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which is a lot of money for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers - so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.
If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left. People would get out of college and say, "Let's start a school." You could have a track at Stanford within the MBA program on how to be the businessperson of a school. And that MBA would get together with somebody else, and they'd start schools. And you'd have these young, idealistic people starting schools, working for pennies.
They'd do it because they'd be able to set the curriculum. When you have kids you think, What exactly do I want them to learn? Most of the stuff they study in school is completely useless. But some incredibly valuable things you don't learn until you're older - yet you could learn them when you're younger. And you start to think, What would I do if I set a curriculum for a school?
God, how exciting that could be! But you can't do it today. You'd be crazy to work in a school today. You don't get to do what you want. You don't get to pick your books, your curriculum. You get to teach one narrow specialization. Who would ever want to do that?
These are the solutions to our problems in education. Unfortunately, technology isn't it. You're not going to solve the problems by putting all knowledge onto CD-ROMs. We can put a Web site in every school - none of this is bad. It's bad only if it lulls us into thinking we're doing something to solve the problem with education.
Lincoln did not have a Web site at the log cabin where his parents home-schooled him, and he turned out pretty interesting. Historical precedent shows that we can turn out amazing human beings without technology. Precedent also shows that we can turn out very uninteresting human beings with technology.
It's not as simple as you think when you're in your 20s - that technology's going to change the world. In some ways it will, in some ways it won't.

This still happens, but in donations to other universities which are already established. The Waltons, for example, have donated large amounts of money to the University of Arkansas for their student union and other features for the campus. It's not exactly forming a new university, but it's still aiding in education. This is the case with most of the more modern donations.
With the old donations, it was basically the best dick-measuring contest ever. Vanderbilt, Stanford, Carnegie, etc just poured money into a university with their name on it pretty much just to whip theirs out in front of the others. Just because it happens more tastefully (through scholarships and renaming convention centers or stadiums and things like that) doesn't mean it isn't happening.

Then they'll send you weekly alumni updates to donate to the university. Mandatory internships at Apple stores.

The reason why this isn't happening in america now is because of the way colleges have become in the US. It's just a sham (aside from surgery schools and our few good other trade schools left) to grub for money now. Plus now that its the information age and if you actually want to learn you can get a far better than college education just researching through the internet now. There is no need for a new college to be made the few actually good ones have plenty of openings and very easy and affordable to get into. Though the main purpose of college(for men) is networking and joining ferternities and guilds in order to gain network contacts to aqquire work, jobs, and resources outside your aimed for career field and what not. And we don't do this much in america outside of Stanford Carnegie Rockafeller Harvard and a few trade schools and scattered guilds (Stone Masons, etc). And with social networking you can theoretically gain all those same benefits if you don't mind not fire forging those friendships(aquaintencships) via hardships and drunken emotional depth exploration.

Apple, Google, Facebook, these kinds of companies you're talking about, would never BUY a university. For one, I don't think they're for sale. Also, they would (if they even considered something like this) would start a new one that "disrupts" the traditional university model.

The problem is there is plenty of dysfunction in US universities that we don't need to replicate AND we currently spend more than most of the developed world on universities as it is. My recommendation would be to pick a few areas of topical relevance in terms of research and development and to develop a foundation with a program designed to grow research in those areas. The problem with giving money to universities is that you can creat lifetime employment for some very inept, corrupt university administrators. You can't ignore the power of incentives.

At CSUN, a deal was struck up to have a partnership with Apple. The deal entailed that students MUST purchase a Tablet (an iOS tablet anyway) for some of their courses, such as biology. Conveniently the mention of this was as you enrolled in the classes, and the tablet must be something close to the iPad mini 2 and above for iOS 9 compatibility. When you bought this iPad at their bookstore, it states it could not be returned, and that no other alternative tablet could be used, as the apps used for the classes were iOS exclusive. Now I'm stuck with a $360~ piece of garbage excuse for software/hardware. Apple buying a university is a terrible idea.

How would buying a University help Apple's bottom line? No, what they should do is usurp the entire business model of education from end-to-end.
Overpriced error-prone materials with shitty error-prone websites, overpriced tuition which mostly goes to useless administrators, overpaid teachers not worth a damn. Pushing students towards useless degrees, and not towards the subjects we actually need expertise in.
If they started hiring experts in a range of fields to build top-notch eBooks with interactive models, and useful online materials, then target those course packages towards highschools and universities, they could undercut the publishers by a wide margin while still turning a profit.
The next move would be to undercut the universities themselves. Online-only degrees, employ a social media aspect to link students and professors geographically for in-person study groups. Eliminate the centralized campus and dramatically cut costs.

Apple Should Buy a University--"More than a century ago Stanford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller used their industrial-age fortunes to build some of our best universities.

If Apple wanted to make a difference they would seriously influence the political and economic structure of America.
But they won't, because they are 110% committed to profits above all else.

[–]GoonCommando 1 point 13 days ago 
As Betteridge would say, "no".
It makes zero sense for a large company to buy a university or start one. They would be betting on their single University to churn out the top 1% of candidates that they need to fulfill their hiring or some part of it. It would be an internal corporate nightmare of "you have to hire X% from the University" which would dilute down real talent within the company. Everyone getting a degree isn't qualified, even from the best universities in the world. Some people have to fail after mom and dad held their hand through college - some go do some menial job for X years, then they hit their fall line and wake up and do great things - some people never cross the line and manage (or work at) a BK for life. (no hit on BK they make a great product)
Now the Apple/Googles of the world get their chance for all Universities to churn out their top talent and they can pick from any and all to make the best choice. They can choose to donate to local universities (many companies do) to help when they want but have no true cost center to worry about. Plus college is technically full of drop outs (41%), that's money invested and lost - If you came up with a business plan to lose 41% of every dollar lets just say you wouldn't have a job long (facts n stuff: https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40) but that's why they make revenue in many ways unrelated to pure education (research/gov grants/donations/etc)

Shouldn't we all be skeptical of a massive consumer electronics conglomerate taking over and redefining what education means in the modern world? Apple would undoubtedly do a great job and probably execute with great success but the implications of this could be disturbing and ultimately damaging.

I would support this if done by a generally unaffiliated corporation. What I mean is, one that can take an relatively brand-agnostic approach. For instance, if Amazon did this but not Apple, Google, or Microsoft.
I understand that Amazon has its own tech that it would no doubt favor, but it isn't a brand that would essentially create future acolytes stuck in a walled garden. They have the Kindle tablets but those hardly comparable to the iEnvironment. There would be no de facto lock-in.
An Apple University would advance technological innovation purely for the benefit of Apple. An Amazon University would be more likely to advance innovation that would more fluidly spread throughout the industry.
Even more appropriate would be a Bill Gates University.

[–]digmystache 1 point 13 days ago 
This is one of those "sounds good to talk about" however in reality would teach the same thing as other schools. The current institutions can just be flooded with donations to run within limits of accreditation said donors want. When noted industrialists started said institutions, there was likely simply a lack of universities period. Those industrialists needed educated people to work for them. Making university more affordable and increasing student capacity would probably make more sense when it comes down to the bottom line.

Apple should not "buy" a university, but they should found one.
As the top comment points out, Google would be in a good place to do this, since they are so heavily involved in research groups already, and aren't as secretive in their operations. Realistically, a joint venture between both would be an excellent idea. Make it somewhere down south, maybe in Gilroy or something where there is land. Or out in the CA delta, where you can get 1000 acres of land for $5m
Merced is also ripe to be hyper-devloped into something much, much bigger, from 6k students to 50K. Of course, you can't give any money to a UC school and expect results, since they will just vaporize it into their own pockets. The UC Berkeley chancellor who makes $532K/year recently put out a message about how the UC need to search for "new funding sources to continue into the future" ... despite him collecting more than double tenured professor with a long career.

See - I actually think this is a terrible idea.
It made sense to do this when Carnegie and Rockefeller were the wealthiest people in the world, around the time of the Civil War and Reconstruction.
There weren't enough colleges and universities to serve the public at large - and many of the ones that did exist were private or liberal arts schools, which trained mostly lawyers and some doctors and whatnot, but not engineers, bureaucrats, etc. Things that society needs to function well.
Now, there are lots of colleges and universities, both public and private. The biggest issue, from the public side, is that they aren't as well funded by state governments as they used to be (from 100% funded by states to like 25% funded by states, in a lot of cases).
So, if Apple (or Tom Cooks) wanted to make a big difference, he'd invest a fortune in public state community colleges and state universities, like his alma mater, Auburn University in Alabama, or all the California schools from which he hires much of his workforce.
That's my opinion, anyway.

While it's great from a humanitarian point of view, it doesn't make much business sense for them to build a university unless they've grown so large they need thousands of new hires each year, or they find a way to make it profitable. Universities only work when needing to make a profit is not an issue.

[–]continuumcomplex 1 point 13 days ago 
Most people don't even know how to search Google properly. Also, the larger the database of resources becomes, the harder it becomes to find the best and most relevant information in that database. So yes, you do need an information professional to teach you how to best operate those resources and find the information you need.
And if you happen to be part of the small percentage of people who know how to actually conduct effective and thorough research, consider how many basic tech-oriented things the average person does not understand and cannot do, but must instead get help for. Now consider that half of all people are worse off than they are.
How many people using Reddit even know what the difference is between a popular and a scholarly article? How many know how to properly apply evaluation criteria to research resources? And assuming they can do that, how many know how to properly cite a journal article, or an interview, or a chapter of an ebook, or a government database?
There are plenty of people who can do all of these things. Many of those were once taught this by a teacher or a librarian. Yet still, many more people don't even know what an article database is. I teach information literacy to college freshmen and when I ask "who can tell me what a database is?" the vast majority of them, including people wanting to be IT majors, have no idea.

[–]Blutoski 1 point 8 days ago 
Databases have evolved well beyond mere search, check out Neo4j that actually correlates the data graphically. You have to remove the human element, humans can't possibly understand the relationships between various forms of data. Predictive and cognitive analytics will remove the human element and the need for a data "scientist."
You want a great example of predictive and cognitive analytics? Look at the dollar stores crushing Walmart. Search would be meaningless here...

Apple definitely needs online courses to teach the iOS ecosystem from novice to professional. So many Australian universities, for example, do such a bad job at teaching iOS development. Many don't even offer electives in wearable computing for iOS nor OS X. It seems to me advantageous for Apple to offer something like Udemy, where learning is self directed and high-quality instructors can be selected (as opposed to some researcher who has 'dabbled' in iOS over the summer break).

The University of Texas at Dallas was founded by the founders of Texas Instruments
http://www.utdallas.edu/create/
UT Dallas owes its existence to three visionaries, Eugene McDermott, J. Erik Jonsson and Cecil Green. They deeply valued education and entrepreneurial activity. These men, who also founded Texas Instruments, found themselves importing talent from outside the state while the region's brightest young people pursued education elsewhere. Having identified the need, the founders took action to serve both their enterprise and Texas by establishing the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest in 1961. It was renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS) in 1967, and, in 1969, the founders transferred the assets of SCAS to the State of Texas, and then-Governor Preston Smith signed the bill establishing UT Dallas.

I think it is high time all of these big corps start giving back to society at large. HUGE wealth gap that needs to be addressed. This would be a great start, but shouldn't be the end.
I'd like to see them take a aggressive/disruptive approach to new post-secondary education. Let's be realistic in that the initial 2-3 years of a 4 year degree is WASTED time! For most STEM degrees, let's skip the bullshit English 101, History 101, etc. These are nothing but time wasters. English as a 2nd language, sure, but not for someone born and raised in the US. Only someone like an Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc. are going to be able to pull this off.
Too many old timers and dreamers out there that say "Oh not studying the Arts! What a travesty. This is vitally important to being a well-rounded person." To which I say, "You're not just wrong, you're stupid." That might be a little harsh, but go to the HQ of Apple and see how many technical engineer staff have knowledge about the Arts. Most of these staff are Indian and Chinese. Some can barely speak the language, yet they are eating our lunch in the STEM fields. Let's wake up American education and become a powerhouse we are capable of. Let's take a look at a different model of not only teaching (ala Reinventing our education by Richard DeLorenzo), but also the curriculum. Apple no longer gets to claim, "We are fighting 'the man'!"...You ARE "the man", so man up and give something back.

[–]OvervektNorsk 0 points 13 days ago* 
What am I on? Quoting Jesus himself;
Steve Jobs - "I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent" Yep, sounds like a GREAT supporter of schools. He'd love Apple to buy and run a school no doubt about it.
More from Education loving and ever so supportive Stevie; "It’s a political problem. The problems are sociopolitical. The problems are unions. You plot the growth of the NEA [National Education Association] and the dropping of SAT scores, and they’re inversely proportional. The problems are unions in the schools. The problem is bureaucracy"
[On Unions] "I’m a very big believer in equal opportunity as opposed to equal outcome. I don’t believe in equal outcome because unfortunately life’s not like that. It would be a pretty boring place if it was. But I really believe in equal opportunity. Equal opportunity to me more than anything means a great education. Maybe even more important than a great family life, but I don’t know how to do that. Nobody knows how to do that. But it pains me because we do know how to provide a great education. We really do. We could make sure that every young child in this country got a great education. We fall far short of that…. The problem there of course is the unions. The unions are the worst thing that ever happened to education because it’s not a meritocracy. It turns into a bureaucracy, which is exactly what has happened. The teachers can’t teach and administrators run the place and nobody can be fired. It’s terrible"
[On Vouchers] "But in schools people don’t feel that they’re spending their own money. They feel like it’s free, right? No one does any comparison shopping. A matter of fact if you want to put your kid in a private school, you can’t take the forty-four hundred dollars a year out of the public school and use it, you have to come up with five or six thousand of your own money. I believe very strongly that if the country gave each parent a voucher for forty-four hundred dollars that they could only spend at any accredited school several things would happen. Number one schools would start marketing themselves like crazy to get students. Secondly, I think you’d see a lot of new schools starting. I’ve suggested as an example, if you go to Stanford Business School, they have a public policy track; they could start a school administrator track. You could get a bunch of people coming out of college tying up with someone out of the business school, they could be starting their own school. You could have twenty-five year old students out of college, very idealistic, full of energy instead of starting a Silicon Valley company, they’d start a school. I believe that they would do far better than any of our public schools would. The third thing you’d see is I believe, is the quality of schools again, just in a competitive marketplace, start to rise. Some of the schools would go broke. Alot of the public schools would go broke. There’s no question about it. It would be rather painful for the first several years"
DM: But deservedly so.
SJ: But far less painful I think than the kids going through the system as it is right now.
[On Digital Learning] "The market competition model seems to indicate that where there is a need there is a lot of providers willing to tailor their products to fit that need and a lot of competition which forces them to get better and better. I used to think when I was in my twenties that technology was the solution to most of the world’s problems, but unfortunately it just ain’t so… We need to attack these things at the root, which is people and how much freedom we give people, the competition that will attract the best people. Unfortunately, there are side effects, like pushing out a lot of 46 year old teachers who lost their spirit fifteen years ago and shouldn’t be teaching anymore. I feel very strongly about this. I wish it was as simple as giving it over to the computer"
"As you’ve pointed out I’ve helped with more computers in more schools than anybody else in the world and I absolutely convinced that is by no means the most important thing. The most important thing is a person. A person who incites your curiosity and feeds your curiosity; and machines cannot do that in the same way that people can. The elements of discovery are all around you. You don’t need a computer. Here – why does that fall? You know why? Nobody in the entire world knows why that falls. We can describe it pretty accurately but no one knows why. I don’t need a computer to get a kid interested in that, to spend a week playing with gravity and trying to understand that and come up with reasons why"
DM: But you do need a person.
SJ: "You need a person. Especially with computers the way they are now. Computers are very reactive but they’re not proactive; they are not agents, if you will. They are very reactive. What children need is something more proactive. They need a guide. They don’t need an assistant. I think we have all the material in the world to solve this problem; it’s just being deployed in other places. I’ve been a very strong believer in that what we need to do in education is to go to the full voucher system. I know this isn’t what the interview was supposed to be about but it is what I care about a great deal"
During a joint appearance with Michael Dell that was sponsored by the Texas Public Education Reform Foundation, Jobs took on the unions by first comparing schools to small businesses, and school principals to CEOs. He then asked rhetorically: “What kind of person could you get to run a small business if you told them that when they came in, they couldn’t get rid of people that they thought weren’t any good? Not really great ones, because if you’re really smart, you go, ‘I can’t win.’ “
He went on to say that “what is wrong with our schools in this nation is that they have become unionized in the worst possible way. This unionization and lifetime employment of K-12 teachers is off-the-charts crazy.”
How much did Steve donate to local schools? You are aware that he suspended Apple;s Charities right? They reinstated them after his death.
A commencement speech at Stanford? By God he's practically an Education Czar! Impressive, most impressive. Commencement speeches? OK.
Pop a blood vessel? Jobs was an asshole, stingy with his money and hated teacher tenure, administrators, and the education industrial complex.
Show me a chart or something about how much he donated to local schools. I bet its not even a tenth of what Gates donated.
Your hero was a selfish prick.

The board of regents for the CSU\UC system is composed of big company CEOs. It hasn't exactly worked in the students favor. What's to say Google or Apple or Intel would perform any better?

[–]NafinAuduin 1 point 13 days ago 
"Top" and "large" are very different things. Additionally the skill set that makes you a desirable new employee for BofA or Google doesn't always translate into "widely employable" or even creative, industrious, or competitive. Why would it? Their goal is to create more qualified workers than they can employ, not to create successful individuals.

No. Contribute back to the country that allowed your success to happen and stop complaining about paying taxes. He gets to hand select which poor kid will hit the zuckerberg lottery.

[–]ianrhett 1 point 13 days ago 
I posted this in the original article comments, too.
TL;DR: I think Apple (and other innovative tech companies) ARE the modern university. The lines between industry and the academy are blurred beyond recognition.
Apple IS the University of its age. When I was hired onto Apple's Interactive Music Group in 1995, I had just finished project managing one of the biggest internet events of the summer of 1995, wiring 15 nightclubs up to the internet and delivering live streaming content from most of them. It was a huge success and as one of the few internet project managers at the time, I had my pick of opportunities.
Apple was calling and the guy who'd become my hiring manager at Apple closed me with this thought: "Working at Apple is like going to B school. You work here for 2-3 years with the smartest people in the world, and you build relationships that last a lifetime because it's such a unique place to work and learn." Or something like that.
The University system we know today was born of a time when academic study and research was one of the leading sources of cultural innovation. That's not so true anymore. It's also true that modern post-secondary education is nothing if not a big business. The lines between industry and the academy are blurred beyond recognition.
This is why I think Apple (and Google and Space X and Genentech, etc.) ARE the modern day University.

More than a century ago, those fortunes where private fortunes owned by families and therefore they could do whatever they wanted with their money.

The Universities it buys would promote plagiarism, patent infringement, claiming scientific breakthroughs of other major universities and scientists as your own. Each classroom would feature sub-par classroom equipment that breaks from normal use and requires you to hire a "Genius" in order to service the equipment for an exorbitant price.
All of the tuition's will be expensive and will not allow you to bring any of your own classroom supplies but instead force you to purchase even basic things like pens and paper from the school store.
You will have tiers of information you can pay for in each class. Only those who pay more can attend the full class. Everyone else will have to leave at the time in which their tier is paid for.
Your education will be touted as "Innovative and Advanced" but you will be so far behind the rest of the modern world and other universities in quality and actual innovation that you will never actually get a job doing anything more than maybe servicing a burger flipping machine at your nearest fully automated McDonald's, designed by Microsoft and IBM.

Call me old fashioned, but I don't think that's a good idea. Apple is a corporation, the primary purpose of a corporation is to improve the finances of investors. A university doesn't fit.

Why do we need universities at all?
Edit: it seem to me the modern version of "University" is just an extension of the "babysitter model" used in public school / high school

[–]CreideikiVAX 9 points 14 days ago 
Because the STEM topics are not something for everyone so you can't put it into high school. There is no reason every high schooler needs to learn the how's and what's of SCADA, or the math that goes behind the functions of nuclear reactor, or neurosurgery.
Secondly, research is important, and for the most part in academia research isn't constrained by "it needs to have a next quarter ROI".
 
Universities and colleges are important, though it would be a better thing to say: Why does every goddamn job need you to have a degree?

[–]worriedhealthy 2 points 14 days ago 
Fuck academic inflation. I feel l like every kid has a double degree, a masters or PhD. That and the value of a standard uni education seems to be getting more worthless.

[–]CreideikiVAX 4 points 14 days ago 
Yes, I agree fully. Seriously, half the jobs do not need degrees. Except of course you do because HR demands it.
It seems like we're steadily heading toward the point where a Bachelor's is the new high school diploma. And the Master's is steadily becoming what a Bachelor's used to be.
 
Also let us take a moment to reflect upon this the greatest of innovations in the job market: "Entry level position! Five years experience minimum, required."

[–]livingonthehedge 3 points 14 days ago 
I think high school is a joke too.
We should be offering apprenticeships instead. And convert universities to true research institutions that offer apprenticeships.

[–]CreideikiVAX 4 points 14 days ago 
Personally I think high school has a place as well. It provides some breadth of learning so people aren't too closed minded and ignorant of things "out there" in the world. Though it, like universities, can do with some improvements.
Personally, if I were in charge of a school system's curricula, I'd start trying to bring some more STEM into high school and more civics education. When I was a high schooler (years ago) science and mathematics education was only required up to grade 10; and the one civics class we had was in grade 10 as well and was only a half goddamn semester (so 2.5 months).
 
With regards to turning universities into research institutions with apprenticeships... that's already a thing. If you do a thesis-based graduate program, you are essentially becoming the apprentice to an expert in your field of study (your supervisor).

[–]-Mountain-King- 2 points 14 days ago 
Apprenticeships are great for the trades, but there's not people interested in teaching to have a 1:1 ratio with everyone interested in learning.

[–]LandslideLyndon 1 point 14 days ago 
That would severely reduce the number of people able to be educated in any given field, unless you allowed a professor to take on 30-50 "apprentices" at a time, at which point I think we've rendered the term meaningless.
I know people like to harp on the "inflation" of education, but human capital is a very real thing, and it is growing every day in the United States even if individual degrees don't seem as valuable anymore.

[–]livingonthehedge 1 point 14 days ago 
Well if every researcher took on 2 apprentices they could double the number of people in that field every 5 years.

[–]LandslideLyndon 1 point 13 days ago 
That still eliminates a huge amount of human capital because not everyone needs to go into research. Our current system is extremely efficient at building the skillset of our population at large. Also if every researcher or professional in their field only took on apprentices as the primary means of training, I would expect nepotism to become a huge problem, with large families dominating certain fields.

[–]livingonthehedge 1 point 13 days ago 
Our current system is extremely efficient at building the skillset of our population at large.
Totally disagree with this.
nepotism to become a huge problem
That could be true.

[–]LandslideLyndon 1 point 13 days ago 
We're training far more scientists, engineers, technicians, business men and women, and pre-professional people than we ever have before. The average education level of our population has greatly increased.
If I'm reading you correctly, your next point is likely to be that many degrees being granted are not valuable--probably the examples of history, gender studies (always mentioned in these discussions), sociology, philosophy, etc. will be used. This is not true. These fields have not deteriorated in quality since the boom of students in post-secondary education--there are just more of them.
We need to distinguish between utility in the current market and utility when it comes to human capital and "the big picture", especially since we are on/r/futurology. Certainly many of those people are having trouble finding jobs right now because there is limited demand for white collar employees, only so many people will survive as entrepreneurs at a time, and corporations are overall much more hesitant to hire anyone right now. The population is still more educated and more capable now than it ever has been, however.

[–]livingonthehedge 1 point 13 days ago 
degrees being granted are not valuable
Are you talking about the piece of paper? No, not valuable in the slightest.

[–]LandslideLyndon 1 point 13 days ago 
Obviously I meant the education, certified by the degree. Certification has its own benefits, however.

[–]CombativeAccount 1 point 14 days ago 
I don't think high school is a joke, but I think expecting high schoolers to commit their educational and financial futures with little guidance is absolutely silly. Much like "Life skills 101" should be a compulsory class, so should "What the fuck do I do with myself? 101". So many students don't have enough home-life stability to answer all those pleading questions about themselves that they're supposedly tasked with answering in time for college applications.
That would segue nicely into your point about apprenticeships. Part of the issue is that high schools (mine did at least) subtly discourage trade schools. It was always 'and remember ya gotta get good grades TO GO TO COLLEGE!' (unless you want do go to a trade school... )
Probably no coincidence that their acceptance rates directly related to their funding.

[–]trancepx 2 points 14 days ago 
I came here for this. Education can happen anywhere, I think formal education systems have a lot of growing to do before they live up to their real capacity. How they fundamentally assess learning is archaic. The tools many universities use are irrelevant, software etc. Education shouldn't be about money, college degrees should be replaced with certification exams.
Students should be more involved in teaching each other, distributed teaching about what genuinely interests them should be prioritized more.
Vastly inadequate and obsolete is how I see most universities with exceptions on those at the cutting edge.

So if captains of industry built universities, why should Apple buy one? The two are not the same.

I think a Musk or Branson university would be way more fun. Google university sounds more like SS training for 1984.

[–]Stiven321 0 points 13 days ago 
So I can over pay for a product i already pay a lot for already.. great.
2025- Apple: We have come up with a new exciting idea that has never been done before, it is called Iniversity. It is exactly like University but you will pay double for it because its made by apple.
I can see Google or bill gates doing something like this before apple does.

[–]Gryff22 0 points 13 days ago 
Apple do. Just they don't brand it as Apple. The University Arts London once got approached by Apple who made the following arrangement: we give you as much cool shit as you like in return we own everything that is made at your institution (from foundation all the way to post doc research). UAL noped the fuck out of that arrangement. But I'm sure at least one uni somewhere had said yes.

/u/thisisbillgates should do this. He has some great ideas about education and would put together an amazing academic environment.

Doubt it. I almost got a job with them but they needed open availability. Wouldn't accept that I couldn't work two nights a week because I was in school. Was willing to quit my other two jobs for it, too. Bummer.

The real money is in religions.

[–]Tebasaki 0 points 13 days ago 
I thought with all the Apple followers it is a religion:
Blind, unenlightened following that thinks they are enlightened, check.
Crazy tithing/overpriced, check.
Apple doesn't pay taxes/overseas tax tricks, check.
Worshiping of a man that once walked on this Earth, Praise be to Jobs.

[–]Beercountry 0 points 13 days ago

pls no.... that would not teach about technology
rather they would teach how to package already existing technology fancy and charge twice the price for the "unpacking experience"

[–]adam_demamps_wingman 0 points 13 days ago 
I think small liberal arts colleges that teach three things--how to think, learn and communicate--would be money better spent. Or maybe small grade schools.

Apple would do it, but it would be in China, and the teachers would be children working 20 hour shifts. Fuck apple, and fuck Steve Jobs.

Apple's sole fiduciary responsibility is to it's own health and that of the owners of it's publicly traded shares. What those owners do with their own personal fortunes is their business, not the company's.

Fuck no. Apple isn't about productivity, it's about giving the illusion that they make the greatest technology products ever. Microsoft and Google would make a 1,000 times better university than Apple ever could.

[–]Mitch_from_Boston 0 points 13 days ago 
It's Apple. They would charge you $200k/semester for a University of Phoenix education.

[–]Shnazzyone 0 points 13 days ago 
If apple did it it would be roughly 40% more expensive than it should be and it would be a degree that you buy mostly for status. On the positive side the degree would have some neat features you can show off once in a while. However, the degree would be useless in roughly 4 years.

[–]Turkey_Pepperoni 0 points 13 days ago 
If apple was a real tech company then maybe but since they pay more to lawyers than electrical engineers and programmers, law school would be about all they could do. Mac users equal chumps. Not only can you build a system that is twice as fast as any Mac but it will also run any OS you choose. Your dollar votes matter and unfortunately Mac users arnt the smartest (they need a simple interface riddled with social engineering pitfalls) but they seem to like spending money.

[–]wurtis16 0 points 13 days ago 
So a university based around marketing?

[–]rnair 0 points 13 days ago 
The great thing about elite universities is that they are an open culture in which student creations are owned by the university and shared. crApple, M$, and other proprietary patent-loving megacorporations will not support this. Universities should be open cultures and not serve one company. Alphabet might work, but if you ask me, Google's got its head in the cloud.

[–]butitdothough 0 points 13 days ago 
Apple university would have a beautiful campus, outdated curriculum and overpriced tuition. Just like all of the other Apple products.

[–]fwowit 0 points 13 days ago 
Apple is one of the least generous, least engaged major companies in American history. It is essentially invisible as a force for good in this country.
Few major companies have done less for the standards of workers overseas. Apple has been begrudging when transgressions have been pointed out (including child labor), and it has done less for the cause of freedom than it should.
Apple has hundreds of billions in the bank, apparently on the premise that whichever company reaches armageddon with the most in the bank wins.
I buy Apple products despite its corporate citizenship, not because of it. If that were the reason, and it soon may be, I'd buy Microsoft all day long.

[–]Kinths 0 points 13 days ago 
I wouldn't want Apple to run a university. A company known for shitty practices and overcharging. Tuition would be 10 times more expensive because your degree will have an apple logo on it.
We could definitely use more tech focused uni's around the world but not from Apple.

[–]Max2000Warlord 0 points 13 days ago

[–]Crash_says -1 points 14 days ago 
Universities as instituted by Stanford/Carnegie/Rockefeller are products of the 19th and 20th century. We need a new regime focused on preparing people for professions and putting classical education second. An on-ramp to being productive and valuable. Anything else is another $150k+ debt boondoggle which nets no real positives to the student's life.

[–]farcedsed 1 point 14 days ago 
Yes, let's change university into a vocational school more than we already have.
That totally will solve all of the problems. ._.

[–]Crash_says -1 points 13 days ago 
Clearly the present situation is working adequately. 4-5 years of education at exorbitant rates to emerge in most cases with no real professional skills. Most people going to college are not getting a PhD to study the cutting edge of their major.. most are just trying to get jobs.

[–]farcedsed 1 point 13 days ago 
The cost of college education is not related to the value of the education. Look at standford, it is officially very expensive, but if you make less than 125,000 a year, its free.
Additionally, the current situation of cost is not because it has retained, a pale version of mind you, the liberal arts model, but instead because of the reduction of state funding of the institutions themselves to a model of loans to the students.
Further, "no real professional skills" is a very large claim, critical thinking, writing clearly with a clear structure, and problem solving skills, are all professional skills in today's world that do emerge from the current model of education independent of the major itself, which the list of marketable skills expands once the major itself is included.
The reduction of the institution which at it's core is the industry of knowledge production and dissemination to something akin to a vocational institution itself is a terrible idea. Regardless of whether they plan on going further in their field in academia does not mean that the essence of the model is not at fault. I would personally argue that the movement away from a broad base liberal arts education is part of the problem, not the solution to this mess.

[–]Crash_says 1 point 13 days ago 
critical thinking, writing clearly with a clear structure, and problem solving skills
Which are skills that should be taught before someone is 18 years old. Most college programs, even ones pointed at STEM degrees, spend a majority of the curriculum teaching either outdated knowledge (in the case of hard science/engineering) or requiring years of complete nonsense (ethics, philosophy, history, and literature for engineering students). The key problem here is "requiring", not that the classes exist. Students are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in inescapable loans to spend a majority of their time studying knowledge that is not applicable to their chosen pursuits and gaining almost zero usable knowledge in their profession (undergrads, not grads).
This cycle has created whole industries where we expect college graduates to have almost no skills and provide zero value for several years while de-training them of the idiocies they have spent a lifetime's worth of debt acquiring.
