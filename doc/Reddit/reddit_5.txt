I know! that article was published in 2012, and says he's been working on it for 7 years! I wonder if he's done yet.
at an average annual rate of 8 to 9 cubic feet using nothing more than RC tractors and trucks!
I guess there's not much else to do in the winter up there

[–]ExplicableMe 2 points 2 hours ago 
In this interview he says his rate is 2-3 cubic yards per year.

Which is 6-9 cubic feet. Right?

My dad owned his own company and worked in the pallet industry for ~30 years, and he used post it note pads just like those ones, and also had mini forklifts in his office. They were my only source of not being a bored 6 year old when I had to go sit in his office for whatever reason.

How big of an order? I want one.

[–]ohyeahthatguy 36 points 2 hours ago 
Over $250 I think. They have different levels of "gifts." My warehouse orders $1,000+ all the time, so we take turns getting the "free gifts." I've gotten an MLB windbreaker, beanie hats, blankets, golf balls, a cooler, ect just from ordering boxes, bubble wrap and tape and shit.

[–]I_KeepsItReal 25 points 2 hours ago 
My company opted out of the free shit and just asked for lowered prices instead. We still get the little stickies regardless!

[–]Paint__ 2 points 8 minutes ago 
I guess the shit wasn't really free if they lowered the prices...

[–]tojoso 6 points 2 hours ago 
I get them for free every time a U-Line salesman comes into our office. We don't even buy anything for them.

These are made from strips of thin luan plywood. The J&J ones are made out of actual plain wood, which makes them look a lot more like tiny versions of the real thing.

[–]tojoso 2 points 2 hours ago 
These are great. We don't even use U-Line but whenever the salesman comes by I make sure to grab a post-it pallet from him. I have a few kicking around my desk.

Lol, I can't tell if you're messing around or not, but if not I assume by now you've understood the inherent coaster nature of the pallet. But if you're actually looking for something to do to fancy them up, I would sand them with increasingly fine sandpaper, and put a clear gloss varnish on them. Ta-da, coasters.

Because that's what they're called(at least where I'm from) it could be a region specific thing. Also companies like Uline sell them as pallets.

[–]atomic223 2 points 1 hour ago 
Where I work, "Pallets" is generally used to refer to the larger ones that we can't use to ship orders. "Skids" generally refers to the smaller ones that we do use for shipping. They're pretty interchangeable though.

[–]warriorprincessdi 2 points 2 hours ago 
The term is often used interchangeably. Pallets are generally wooden and of a uniform size... skid is a more general term, they are rough sizes and shapes/matierals... usually used to 'skid' an object along the ground or when loading from my experience....

I want one of those so badly I would pay.

[–]eoliveri 1 point an hour ago 
Disappointed: it says "pallets" but I read "mallets".

[–]Megatron_McLargeHuge 1 point 1 hour ago 
Do they charge you if you don't return the pallet when you're done?

[–]JLBPBBHR 1 point 1 hour ago 
So does mine!!!!

[–]br34nn4 1 point 1 hour ago 
i need that!!!!!

[–]CptFizz 1 point 1 hour ago 
Fun fact: pretty much every logistics company does that.

[–]JimDiego 1 point an hour ago 
It's going to take a very long time to collect enough of those for a decent bonfire.

[–]You_know_my_name_ 1 point an hour ago 
Be careful because those pallets are often treated with harmful chemicals. You shouldn't have them on your desk and don't ever burn them!

And that company will be forever associated with giving me splinters.

Paper cuts and splinters. Now that's a steal!

[–]acc0919mc 1 point an hour ago 
My uncle used to send us a bunch of these from boise cascade. I used to rip the paper off and mess with the mini pallets

[–]septvea 1 point an hour ago 
I appreciate miniature things so much.

[–]trettel 1 point an hour ago 
i have one of these on my desk at work, those crafty mother fuckers!

[–]asorba 1 point an hour ago 
Pretty common...I get at least one of these a year from my fright carriers.

How to make the best of a situation when you say you need 100,000 pallets delivered to your ants house.

[–]sonicboi 1 point an hour ago 
I have one of those from a government agency! 😄

[–]DoctorSteve 1 point 59 minutes ago 
I love office supplies and palletes and forklifts and orders and deliveries and (meeting) deadlines.

[–]squidgun 1 point 58 minutes ago 
I want one. Where can I get one?

[–]dwiggitypoo 1 point 57 minutes ago 
Home Depot did that too!

[–]Murray_Bannerman 1 point 56 minutes ago 
With about a thousand of those, you can make some sweet patio furniture.

[–]JohnTravoltasHair 1 point 47 minutes ago 
OMG I WANT A TINY WOODEN PALLET PLZ

[–]crushcastles23 1 point 46 minutes ago 
My former boss always wanted a pallet of post its...

[–]LithePanther 1 point 46 minutes ago 
How do I get one

[–]Spectrum184 1 point 43 minutes ago 
These are actually pretty common in the manufacturing world.

[–]TheRealDickPoncho 1 point 43 minutes ago 
hey OP how do we know you aren't a giant with giant pallets and even gianter post-its??

[–]jakeobi 1 point 41 minutes ago 
There was a sod farming company near my hometown that did that, but they als had pictures on the sides of the paper that made it look like sod on a pallet

[–]gerple 1 point 41 minutes ago 
this is a cool little craft. I wonder who makes them.

[–]L3ndo 1 point 40 minutes ago 
Good thing you blurred the number out

[–]shouldbeworkingbut 1 point 39 minutes ago

[–]LeMoofinateur 1 point 32 minutes ago 
We have some of those from a hauliers we use at work.

[–]__PRIME 1 point 23 minutes ago 
For some reason I really want to see a miniature warehouse model with them on their little pallets.
I am so alone.

[–]Double-Up 1 point 22 minutes ago 
Do they lift the tiny pallets with dinner forks?

[–]uzimonkey 1 point 20 minutes ago 
I just got though one of these. It had a stack of paper on it like 6 inches high and took me around 10 years.

[–]Reggae4Triceratops 1 point 18 minutes ago 
Hey! I got these too! (different company). Mine is a significantly larger stack though.

[–]Spaztazoid 1 point 16 minutes ago 
I wonder how long people until people hoard them to make some sort of rack to post on pintrest.

[–]ChaosMotor 1 point 15 minutes ago 
Great now cover it with tiny little architectural blocks.

[–]Complete_Novice 1 point 15 minutes ago 
I used to work in the paper industry sheeting and palletising board for sheet fed printers, seeing these things again is like having a flashback of 'nam.

[–]poopmat1 1 point 15 minutes ago 
Lots of construction suppliers use them I get them from titan block

[–]HeartDenko 1 point 14 minutes ago 
The restaurant I worked at had one of those. When the notes were all gone I stole the little pallet and made it into a coaster.

[–]marshmallowwisdom 1 point 11 minutes ago 
The phone number is blurred, but the company's name isn't? Reminds me of that Lisa. S/ L. Simpson joke from The Simpsons.

[–]DeathzEmbrace 1 point 9 minutes ago 
Hey I work for this shitty company maybe posting some shitty item will get us free publicity..

[–]Manice08 1 point 7 minutes ago 
so does our shipping material supplier

[–]PM_ME_YOUR_RECEIPTS 1 point 5 minutes ago 
Not even skid wrapped

[–]playerIII 1 point 4 minutes ago 
Bullshit, that ain't a pallet. Pallets are covered in splinters and broken beyond use literally every time.
Then you have those bullshit blue painted ones that itch like shit when they scratch you and are heavy as balls.

[–]voyager123456789 1 point 5 hours ago 
I want one.

[–]rellewwork 1 point 5 hours ago 
I have the same thing, better quality though from CEI.
I actually have a desk model of a CHEP pallet as well from back when I worked for a company that held excess inventory of theirs.

[–]mithanson 1 point 3 hours ago 
I'd buy that

[–]omnipotentcg 1 point 2 hours ago

[–]ExplicableMe 1 point 2 hours ago 
The look of this and the concept take me back to when I was a little kid and my dad used to get stuff like this at work. Seems very mid-century.

[–]signingupagain 1 point 55 minutes ago 
Looks cool but splintery.

I'm getting splinters just looking at that.
