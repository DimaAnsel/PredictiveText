TIL there’s a Japan indoor vegetable-factory that produces 10,000 heads of lettuce a day while using just 1% of the amount of water needed for outdoor fields. LEDs emit light at ideal wavelengths for plant growth, while also optimizing night and day cycles, allowing lettuce to grow 2.5 times faster. (inhabitat.com)

You see those tyvek suits that they are wearing? I bet employees are made to shower before they enter that place and put on the suits to avoid disease and aphid infestation. Just 1 aphid in there...

[–]thirdculture_hog 59 points 14 days ago 
You can use aphid resistant cultivars, and rotate pesticides. Still a pain in the ass. Source : I do pest resistance research and work with greenhouse plants

[–]galileosmiddlefinger 19 points 14 days ago 
Could you use natural aphid predators, like ladybugs, in a space like that? I'm just wondering about the feasibility of producing pesticide-free crops this way, but I don't know the tech/research like you do.

[–]speadskater 10 points 14 days ago 
There are a lot extraneous variables involved in that. Namely effectiveness and diseases.

[–]galileosmiddlefinger 4 points 14 days ago 
Makes sense -- thanks for replying.

[–]Mishnz 5 points 13 days ago 
I work in the hydroponics industry. The best growers here use a predatory wasp to kill aphids. The problem with this is that of you have no aphids then there is nothing for the wasps to eat and they die. So it only works if you actually hand a aphid problem already.
This lab probably uses an airlock where they spray for bugs or as mentioned they will be bug resistant. Usually healthy plants don't have a problem.

[–]Zillatamer 3 points 13 days ago 
So you just keep a supply of wasps continuously fed outside the facility and release some inside periodically to ensure low aphid count?

[–]tyranicalteabagger 2 points 12 days ago 
I bet someone somewhere is making a good living raising aphids and wasps.

[–]thirdculture_hog 3 points 14 days ago 
I think it's feasible and I've heard of people doing it. My lab researches plant defenses to aphids, so I'm not too familiar with the commercial applicability of ladybugs or praying mantes indoors

[–]noir_chatLA 3 points 13 days ago 
it's not a spatial issue. it's depends on the season and predator. specifically for convergent ladybugs, they have a specific dormant stage called reproductive diapause where they don't mate or eat. this occurs in the winter time when aphid population shrinks, so they fly to 5000ft elevation to hibernate (in southern california). if you release them in the winter, they'll want to fly away AND they wouldn't eat anyway. so releasing species specific ladybugs it's important to know what you're doing. TL;DR know what you're buying, and when you're buying.

[–]galileosmiddlefinger 2 points 13 days ago 
Huh, TIL. Thanks.

[–]speadskater 3 points 14 days ago 
I said aphids, meant pests in general. I work with greenhouses as well, but know little about resistance, I just know that in a closed system like that, obessive cleanliness is worth thousands.

[–]thirdculture_hog 1 point 14 days ago 
Agreed. I don't know about your facility but the reason we're so anal about pests is that we are worried about infectious diseases that can be devastating. We also can't study plant signaling in response to pests effectively if we are not sure our stressors are the only ones affecting them. We grow our plants in insect cages inside the greenhouse to help prevent infestation but we still need to spray regularly

[–]WoodFiend 2 points 14 days ago 
I try to grow mint in my bedroom window and I have aphid problems constantly. I can't imagine how bad it would be in a place like this.
Any easy way to handle them at home? I've been trying to soap/water/pinch of cayenne in a spray bottle method but they keep coming back.

[–]thirdculture_hog 5 points 14 days ago 
For small plants, I'd just squeeze by hand. It's a bit laborious but it works. Start at the top and pinch the aphids between the leaves and your thumbs. Work your way to the bottom. Do this every day for a week and you'll effectively disrupt their reproductive cycle. My acquaintances who grow "mint" indoors do the same and they swear by it.

[–]Diogenes__The_Cynic 2 points 13 days ago 
I don't know anything about plants, but have you tried to microwave the dirt before you put seeds in it?

[–]speadskater 2 points 13 days ago 
Aphids don't come in the dirt. They are mites that attach to the leaves.

[–]Discover2010 2 points 13 days ago 
In an enclosed environment, could you just displace all the oxygen with some kind of gas that would suffocate all the bugs but leave plants unharmed?

[–]tyranicalteabagger 2 points 13 days ago 
Seems like maintaining clean room like conditions would be preferable to spraying poison all over everything, if it's an option between the two and it probably is in a controlled environment like that.

[–]thirdculture_hog 4 points 13 days ago 
It's easier said than done. We do a pretty good job preventing infestations but they are inevitable and need to be controlled. "Poison" is a relative term. A lot of pesticides are very specific to certain pests. Often we use fungal and/or bacterial toxins that are toxic to the pest that's infesting our plants. Sometimes we use K salts of fatty acids (think Dawn dish soap) that only affect soft bodied pests and are contact based, so they don't linger.

[–]tyranicalteabagger 2 points 13 days ago 
Nice to know you go for the benign options most of the time. It almost seems like with soap and some h2o2 you can kill a huge percentage of plant pests.

[–]Soperos 2 points 13 days ago 
Do you know if there are any health risks with pesticides that don't recommend wearing breathing protection? I work in pest control and use a lot of liquids (Brands: Suspend, Gentrol, Exciter, Permethrin, etc).

[–]thirdculture_hog 2 points 13 days ago 
Depends on the pesticide. The label is your friend. Some can be skin irritants. Probably best to wear PPE as standard protocol

[–]Soperos 2 points 13 days ago 
I always wear the recommended. And of course I've read the label. My question was if there are risks that are known but might not be mentioned on the label.

[–]ghfjdkty 1 point 14 days ago 
iirc they dont use pesticides in that facility
ninja edit: or maybe they do, I've only heard about the Toshiba facility, didn't realize this was a different one

[–]Rubix-Pubes 1 point 9 days ago 
do pesticides cause cancer?

[–]SinCalFire -3 points 13 days ago 
Pesticides are horrible. Stop killing the bees

[–]thirdculture_hog 3 points 13 days ago 
Not all pesticides affect bees. Spraying something in a controlled research environment means that pollinators are not exposed to them.
We perform this research in order to breed pest resistant cultivars that require less use of pesticides.

[–]speadskater 2 points 13 days ago 
That's a super generalization. It's like saying plants are horrible because poison ivy gives you a rash.

[–]christosbern 2 points 14 days ago 
What would just 1 aphid do?

[–]speadskater 2 points 14 days ago 
Aphids reproduce both sexually and asexually, meaning they can both breed and adapt stupidly fast.

[–]christosbern 2 points 14 days ago 
I for one welcome our new Aphid overlords

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 14 days ago 
Crop cycles are so short 1 aphid is probably not going to make any difference at all. The big worry is gonna be of the microscopic variety.

[–]speadskater 1 point 14 days ago 
My worry would be that they have no way to look in the center of the rows and judging by the suits, they worry about that too.

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 14 days ago 
Perhaps, but they're likely wearing the suits because of fungal pathogens. Not aphids.

[–]speadskater 1 point 14 days ago 
I can only imagine, with a closed water system like that. I wonder if they UV sanitize the water as it cycles around.

[–]creativeusername84 1 point 13 days ago 
Just put some Lady Bugs in there.

[–]speadskater 2 points 13 days ago 
There are a lot of externalities involved in that. Especially involved with the spread of diseases.

[–]Muckerjee 2847 points 14 days ago* 
As I understand it, the trade off here is increased energy usage.

[–]Underoath2981 6 points 14 days ago 
California uses roughly 46% of their water for animal agriculture. If they stopped, or cut down on that they'd have no issue.

[–]platypuspracticus 1 point 9 days ago 
Isn't most of that from the feed? You could still use the grow method on the alfalfa.

[–]Underoath2981 1 point 9 days ago 
I'm confused by what you mean. Continue growing alfalfa for humans to eat? Switch to alfalfa?

[–]platypuspracticus 1 point 9 days ago 
The majority of the water used in production of meat comes from the feed used: alfalfa.

[–]Underoath2981 1 point 8 days ago 
Yes, a lot goes into waste management, and cows drink a good chunk by themselves also. There'sa lot of other things that go into the issue with animal agriculture as well, but that's another can of worms.

[–]arandomasiandude 2 points 14 days ago 
Or some aquafina "PWS" water bottle?

[–]Herbert_Von_Karajan 1 point 14 days ago

[–]triksterx 1 point 14 days ago 
Brilliant, why haven't we thought of this before? We'll just move all of the farms to beaches. Surely there isn't a problem getting terrestrial plants to grow in a marine environment. They're just too lazy to take root in all the wonderful sand.

[–]CottonStig 1 point 14 days ago 
You spelt animal agriculture wrong

[–]_ben_lowery 19 points 14 days ago 
Also makes a closed loop system simpler if the volume is smaller again handy if water pressure continues to increase at the rate that it is.
Also if we end up using more and more desalinated water it helps to not have to use so damn much to grow things like Lettuce and Alfalfa.

[–]candybomberz 12 points 14 days ago 
Yes exactly. More energy usage for growing the plant, but less for the desalinated water, one of the main advantages of this system. With population growing and peaking at 11b eventually we will likely have to use indoor growing and desalinated water anyway, so a water efficient system like this is good news for the long run.

[–]_ben_lowery 10 points 14 days ago 
Those countries with a lot of sun and not a lot of water, would be interesting to see what would happen if you used Solar PV to generate the electricity to run the plant mostly automated and desalinate the water as well, You'd pretty much have a lettuce factory that was self-generating.
Hot countries without much water do tend to have quite a bit of space.

[–]BattleHall 5 points 14 days ago 
Also makes a closed loop system simpler if the volume is smaller
Actually, smaller volume closed loop systems, and/or systems with a high plant mass to circulating volume are much harder to manage, due to the lack of buffering and reserve capacity. Run-to-waste systems are probably the easiest to manage, but true to their name they are very water and nute inefficient.  

[–]gravshift 1 point 13 days ago 
Aquaponic systems get the buffer by the huge grow tanks for the fish, optional bivalve tank for biofiltration, the particulate filter vortex system, nitrification reactors, UV scrubber, and both levels of oxygenation. Lots of water flowing through that.
But hey, who said biosecurity and saving water was cheaper then just letting perfectly good nutrients flow into the watershed?

[–]BattleHall 1 point 13 days ago 
...which is why I generally wouldn't consider most aquaponics setups to be low circulating volume systems. Not sure who you're arguing with/snarking at; I love aquaponics, though balancing the inputs, nitrification, and plant biomass such that you can actually get a useful harvest from the aquaculture side can be a bit tricky. They're also harder to restart than a pure hydro setup if you experience a real hard crash.

[–]gravshift 1 point 13 days ago 
No snark, I like them too.
More poking fun at the hippies who think they are easy. Only way they are easy is if you have lots of automated stuff to regulate it and have another system running parallel to restart if you have to purge everything.
The mussel biofilter chamber, particulate matter vortex, and end loop UV sterilizer is stuff I am interested in due to how the biosecurity in these systems tends to be attrocious and are easy to ruin from particulate matter. That and if you remixed it with Aeroponics, the particulate matter would be a smelly cloggy mess in the root mister system.
Is kind of neat to have what is basically a SCADA system for veggies.
Where I live, channel catfish would be the prefered fish, but the culture systems for them are rough (though at least you can raise your own eggs and fry if you really are serious business)

[–]n0th1ng_r3al 1 point 14 days ago 
When you say closed loop you mean the water used for irrigation is reused?

[–]ACDRetirementHome 1 point 14 days ago 
Alfalfa
But my cheap beef!

[–]llcorona 1 point 13 days ago 
Meaning future lettuce will taste slightly salty?

[–]Drew_Shoe 11 points 14 days ago 
Water management issues are not as dependent on climate change, but Vertical Farming CAN certainly play a role in food security against climate related issues. If food can be grown indoors in urban environments at scale, it disrupts logistical and transportation issues AND temperature issues, in addition to soil quality issues. As long as temperatures can be regulated efficiently, vertical farming has huge energy and sustainability implications.
I'm interested in seeing cogeneration applications, where vertical farms take advantage of heat, nutrients and energy biproducts of other industrial production facilities.

[–]zilfondel 2 points 13 days ago 
It would be simpler to just install gardens and vertical farms on existing rooftops. However, this type of crop won't scale for carbs - ie, potatoes, corn, rice or wheat due to the sheer square footage you would need (see my post below - essentially you'd need 4 trillion square feet, an area the size of Montana).

[–]gravshift 2 points 13 days ago 
Potatoes it would work fine alot less get grown then you would think.
Corn, Rice, Soy, and wheat are a problem but there is a solution.
Genetically engineered yeast that reproduces the Meal for each food stock, that gets its energy directly from electrical or chemical sources. Custom engineered metabolic cycle and everything. Then all you need is energy, water (way less then growing plants), Carbon Dioxide, and oxygen.
The different types of meal is then used for making all the various processed ingredients for different food stuffs. Pressure form it right and you could even approximate rice grains directly.
One nuclear reactor powering bioreactors could feed a million people.
This and vat grown meat would put most of traditional farming out of business. Can't compete with that level of biosecurity and no fertilizer or water issues.

[–]tons_of_phun_ 4 points 14 days ago 
So California then?

[–]Ihwfarms 2 points 14 days ago 
Aquaponics would be good too.

[–]ScrubQueen 2 points 14 days ago 
There's a school for kids with autism in my town that did an aquaponics system as part of their science program. They even built the LED lighting systems and had it hooked up to a raspberry pi to regulate the light cycles and water. The guy that supervised them even designed an app to let them monitor the ph and nutrient levels as well as change the light cycles. All of the food they grew was used in their cafeteria too.

[–]BattleHall 2 points 14 days ago 
It's not like this is new, other than the LEDs; Israel has been doing substantial commercial scale hydro for decades.

[–]candybomberz 2 points 14 days ago 
Greenhouses use a lot of Water I think ? Not 100% sure. This tech only uses 1% of the usual water amount.

[–]giraffenpuss 1 point 14 days ago 
Greenhouses use less water than outdoor fields.
The vertical technology in the article uses infinite times the usual amounts of artificial sunlight.

[–]Woosah_Motherfuckers 1 point 14 days ago 
When water runs low. Ftfy.

[–]Mr_Quiscalus 1 point 14 days ago 
Growing lettuce is the easiest thing to grow and provides almost no calories or nutrition. I'll be impressed when this is done with fruits or vegetables that are the fruit/seed of the plant. That's when plants really expend energy.

[–]ScrubQueen 1 point 14 days ago 
Dude, all this is is hydroponics. You can grow almost any kind of plant you want, people have been doing it with weed for decades.
My boyfriend and I ghetto rigged an ebb and flow system using rubbermaid tubs and grew over six different kinds of lettuce and basil in a closet. The yields were enormous, some basil leaves got as big as my hand and we were always giving the extra away to friends and neighbors. We also grew peppers and tomatoes that were excellent and we always had more than we needed.
It would be breathtakingly easy to convert a warehouse into a large scale hydroponic farm and grow pretty much anything you wanted.

[–]Mr_Quiscalus 1 point 13 days ago 
Hydroponics isn't the issue. They're using LEDs. I'm all about hydroponics. I've got an aquaponics system outside :)

[–]ScrubQueen 1 point 13 days ago 
LEDs are probably the cheapest and most energy efficient way of doing hydroponics though, especially on a larger scale where heat would be an issue with conventional lighting.

[–]Mr_Quiscalus 1 point 13 days ago 
But they just plain suck at growing stuff. Honestly it's been a few years since I really looked into them. I remember talking to a guy at a hydro store and he said he stopped carrying them because he felt like he was ripping off his customers because they never lived up to the hype.

[–]ScrubQueen 1 point 13 days ago* 
Hydro guys tend to swear by high pressure sodium but they are the shittiest light source when it comes to efficiency. They only produce yellow light and the heat that they give off will likely kill your plants if you don't ventilate properly.
LEDs can be any color and most growers who use them have either alternating blue/red or just purple light because the plants will absorb it more efficiently. The LED pro grower lights are stupid expensive but you can make them yourself pretty easily for cheap if you're electronically savy. I've used LEDs for years and they work just as well if not better than regular lights in my experience.

[–]Mr_Quiscalus 1 point 13 days ago 
by regular lights do you mean hps?

[–]ewbf 1 point 13 days ago

There's the zero energy universe theory that basically says there's a bunch of negative matter/energy in places that balances out all the positive stuff we see around us... This means before and after the big bang the net energy was zero, therefore there was no change and you don't need some weird massive outside source of energy to start things off.

Being OK with realizing the current correct answer is "We aren't sure, yet." and moving along, is quite liberating.

Big bang came from the start of a 4th dimensional black hole. There is theory about this and the math works out for the expansion of our universe and the expansion of the event horizon of a 4th dimensional black hole

[–]snapy666 1 point 13 days ago 
Actually if I understood it correctly, time was created with the big bang, so there is no before the big bang.
btw. There is an interesting book about this topic from physicist Lawrence M. Krauss:

I want to understand it, but it's too... mindboggling.

[–]RedChld 1 point 13 days ago 
The big bang didn't just create all the stuff in the universe. It is an expansion of spacetime. So there was no before the big bang, because there was no time before the big bang. Time began with the big bang.

[–]cheezstiksuppository 1 point 13 days ago 
There is some theory in astrophysics that says that all the energy in the universe cancels out. There is actually zero net energy, accounting for gravity, EM, dark energy etc etc. I don't know if anybody believes it or not. Also you'd have to pick the right zero point.

[–]GenuinelyNot[🍰] 1 point 14 days ago 
And think, we are made of that energy so we are kinda like that energy turned into awareness now we are so complex.
Imagine if you could focus really hard and feel that energy that connects us all.
Maybe someone's done it before, like Jesus or Mohammed or Buddha.

[–]NaturalSelectionDied 0 points 14 days ago 
It didn't come from. Beginning and end are only human constructs of subjective misunderstanding. Eventually the universe will stretch so far that it will begin to pull back eventually collapsing into itself, restarting the process and time as we know it.

[–]bcgoss 1 point 14 days ago

Not really. Most oil wasn't made from dinosaurs - it was made from giant forests before animals had started inhabiting land. Those forests (free of herbivores) don't exist anymore because life found a balance. Oil isn't exactly renewable, even with patience exceeding the existence of humans.

God made enough of it to last forever.
Actually, there are substantial numbers of Americans who believe that God put just enough coal/oil/natural gas in to the ground to last right up until the Biblical end of the world. (and similarly, believe that maybe burning all this stuff will have an impact on the climate, but again, that God set things up so that it won't be a problem prior to the 'end times'. Well, at least for them the "true" believers.)
I wish I was making this up, but it's genuinely a factor in Republican politics. Underneath the silly/absurd "I am not a scientist" rhetoric is this current that believes (quite self-servingly, of course) that humanity can just plow ahead recklessly because none of the consequences will really have an impact (on them.)
I'd love to read the internal Exxon memos about how they use this (and potentially promote it) in lobbying/politics/etc.

[–]The_Lion_Jumped 10 points 14 days ago

It's actually way more common than that, just not really articulated that way. All the people who think that the world is going to end in their time don't have much reason to support clean energy rather than the more convenient fossil fuels. Basically all my moms' church friends from like 5 different churches were all like this, plus the entire family of one of my bosses a while back, who moved to an entire like-minded community... You can also lump in most of the people who watch the 700 Club and CBN in general.
This may be something of a bible-belt thing, but there are certainly hundreds of thousands, in not low millions, of people who subscribe to this philosophy, and they have really disproportionate political clout considering their still relatively-low numbers compared to the rest of America.

As I understand it, according to estimates 10 years ago we are supposed to run out in 2017, 2020 and 2021.

[–]SocialFoxPaw 18 points 14 days ago* 
It won't happen like that, like in the Lorax movie when they cut the last tree down... it won't be like that with the last drop of oil coming out of the ground and then the whole operation shutting down forever...
What will happen is that the oil will become increasingly harder to access to the point that competing technologies will win out and make it unprofitable to extract the remaining oil. Drilling companies will close their doors one by one over many years as their profit margins become thinner and thinner.

We will never truly run out. As it becomes scarcer, the price will just increase until an alternative source is more economical to use. At that point, it will still be used, especially for petroleum-based materials, but we won't be using it for transportation etc. There will always be enough for zip-lock bags for example, but the Navy won't be using it to power its warships.

I have a solution to the energy problem. It involves sequestering huge amounts of hydrogen within an orb, with enough density and gravitational force to sustain fusion. This would be highly dangerous and have to be kept millions of miles from earth. But my calculations show that the radiation could still be enough to sustain all plant life on earth. Could be much more economical [EDIT: than] indoor lettuce if the orb could be made for free.
EDIT: A number of people bring up California and water scarcity. That scarcity was politically manufactured by the poor foresight of farming in the desert in the first place, enabled by manipulating laws to steal bring in water from hundreds of miles away. And continued subsidies and laws that provide water for ridiculously cheap rates, and other explicit and implicit subsidies for farming. If there were an objective way to quantify all the externalities, a lot of farming should probably move out of California. The water problem isn't intrinsic, it's because people insist on farming there. It makes little sense to do indoor farming in California, because there is plenty of sun and land in the Central Valley, and energy isn't particularly cheap. (At least Japan has scarce land.) Indoor farming definitely makes sense on a space ship, and for marijuana cultivation, and perhaps a few other special cases. But in general it's simply not economical at large scale, in part because the sun provides a huge amount of energy (to plants) for free.

Sort of, but unless your planet has a sizeable magnetic field at that range the off gassing and radiation will strip away your atmosphere.

[–]pixl_graphix 49 points 14 days ago 
There is a flaw in your equation. This orb you are creating will only be able to provide energy to one half of any sphere orbiting it at any given time. This is highly inefficient as the growing time for each plant will be halved also. Please go back to your drafting table and come back with a more optimal solution.

Halo ring structure with orb in the center of the ring.

[–]pixl_graphix 1 point 13 days ago 
Half the halo is facing away from the orb so you are still only at 50% space utilization.

[–]gramathy 1 point 13 days ago 
Most plants can survive some time without the orb providing it energy, so how about we just rotate the Earth regularly and it'll have alternating periods of energy and non-energy?

[–]pixl_graphix 1 point 13 days ago 
Because most vegetable plants only need a short night time if any at all. Cabbages reach 127 pounds with only 5 hours of night in Alaska. Chickpeas show no negative effects in 24 hour sunlight.

[–]Aken_Bosch 1 point 13 days ago 
No that's actually a feature. one part is gathering energy, while another is activly cools off, so that temprature would stay in equilibrium, and not constantly rise.

[–]psychicesp 1 point 14 days ago 
The issue with using the sun is that you couldn't stack the plants without blocking the light to the lower levels. In order to stack, light has to be generated. If energy is to be used to generate light, it should be only generating usable wavelengths

[–]apo383 1 point 14 days ago 
You obviously get the joke, and what you say is true. But the problem with indoor growth is the cost of energy. It is rarely economical except for high-value crops like marijuana. The trade-offs between water, energy, and land use have long been understood. Maybe the one newer thing here is that LEDs can indeed tune a narrower spectrum than incandescents. The sun's extra spectrum is not a concern, because we don't pay for it.

[–]psychicesp 1 point 14 days ago 
Yes, but extra spectrum could potentially power a solar cell. With more efficient solar cells, otherwise unused parts of the spectrum could be used to produce light in a usable wavelength, resulting in a net gain of usable light without any energy source rather than the sun.
Right now the technology to grow indoors and without the sun exists, not to save money on energy, but in areas where land and water are scarce enough to justify the energy expense. It's still awesome technology because there may be a time in the future when it does save energy, and it'll be convenient that it has already been developed and used, thus, refined.

[–]CassandraVindicated 1 point 13 days ago 
There is a lot of indoor growing being done near large cities in the US, mainly to grow vegetables. Good restaurants will pay a premium for fresh, out of season veges that don't have to be shipped 1000 miles. That's enough to offset the energy costs.

[–]the_one2 1 point 14 days ago

'probably' would work, but definitely would be cost and resource prohibitive.
Greenhouses work today and will work well tomorrow where 90% of people live. For those extreme Northern/Southern climates that are hindered by the sunlight, there's alternatives such as those in the link.

[–]OVERGROUND7 0 points 14 days ago 
Most climates are hindered by sunlight and winter. I don't know the number but I'd bet that a large portion of the worlds population live in an area where you can't grow anything for 4-5 months of the year.

[–]1standarduser 0 points 14 days ago 
Most populations live below Vancouver, BC.
Greenhouses work there all year long. Certain crops take more light and therefore are rotated out based on season. Also light dep in summer or added lights in winter can allow the same crop to go all year.

[–]kingrootintootin 2 points 14 days ago 
tack on a few grow lights to keep light cycles constant in the middle of the winter (you don't need enough power to promote extra growth, just enough to keep the plant in the right growth phase), and you still use a shitload less power than all indoor lighting. people don't seem to realize that we don't need to completely reinvent the light source, just supplement it when needed

[–]40kkm 84 points 14 days ago 
This is vertical hydroponics, using LED lights. There is no soil in this system and it has some really intense environmental controls and automation. Hydroponics is when the roots are directly given the exact nutrients they need through irrigation, soaking, dipping, or misting. This allows the growers to control all the nutrients, pests, parasites, and growth rates for their plants.
Funny enough a whole bunch of power/electric product companies in Japan have vertical farms. Panasonic, GE, Phillips, they all have them.

[–]1SweetChuck 31 points 14 days ago 
It seems like, from a power standpoint, if you've got power plants that generate the same amount of energy all day long, this could be a use for excess/off-peak energy.

I mean, if they're needing a certain bacteria, you could introduce a nutrient in the water that the bacteria could feed on. If they're getting killed by the UV light that would be a simple matter of shielding.
This is all speculation based on this claim that there's some bacteria missing. We've been growing crops hydroponically for a long time.

[–]VaATC 1 point 14 days ago 
The largest issue being skirted over in this conversation, and one you hinted at with your comment, is that the problem is not in growing enough food for the world's population but distribution of said food stuffs before it goes bad.

[–]jdaar 1 point 14 days ago 
I think the idea is that you have multi-level buildings where you grow your food on some levels and that food is consumed by the population of the apartments in the same building. This is another factor that needs to be placed in the energy equation because the cost and energy to transport food is staggering. Eventually we will run out of land if we grow unchecked, we have scale up if we want to expand.

[–]UnitedDC_kicker 2 points 14 days ago 
Not that simple. It requires thousands of different species of bacteria to create a healthy functioning soil, a majority of which are unknown and unculturable. I also dought that they would be able to narrow it down to specific species ( maybe functional group). soil microbial ecologist are not good enough to be able to add a specific carbon/ nutrient to select for the species they want in soil. That works for a small percentage of bacteria on agar plates,
Source. Masters in microbial ecology focusing on bacterial communities of wetland soils.

[–]Gullex 2 points 14 days ago 
So why is hydroponics a thing?

[–]UnitedDC_kicker 1 point 14 days ago 
I honestly don't know that much about hydroponic systems. I would assume that you are supplying all the functions naturally supplied by bacteria and soil. That is a buffered ion content and ph. Instead of decomposition and nitrafication you just give the plants nutrients.

[–]Max_Thunder 1 point 14 days ago 
Growing bacteria that can easily grow in dirt outside must not be that difficult.
The problem is we often have no idea what those bacteria are doing. Take our intestinal flora for instance. Studies show it can affect our mental health, our immune system, etc. Yet no single probiotics supplement is identical to another because nobody knows what works (although they all have amazing reviews on amazon).
I remember some Japanese supplement, it was called Essential Microorganisms or EM-2, you'd grow it in water+molasses, and add it to your garden. Some people also used it as a dietary supplement. I also remember stories about using some fresh soil from a forest to "supplement" your garden.

Aquaponics has the downside of solids (poop) vs just liquid nutrients for the hydroponics.
the poop creates problems such as pumps/piping clogging and faster degradation of water pumps. In a vertical setup, i'd bet the problems are increased.
aquaponics seems to do a little better in semitraditional horizontal setups.

Um, fish don't fix nitrogen. N comes from thunderstorms, legumes (or the microbes that prefer to live with legumes) or factories. They may return a decent deal of n back to the plants, but the n comes from an outside source.

[–]squeamish 53 points 14 days ago

[–]Soldier_Of_FORTRAN 17 points 14 days ago 
Um, fish don't fix nitrogen.
You're right! I just did a quick googling and the fish's utility (re: nitrogen) is in providing waste for nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

[–]OodalollyOodalolly 3 points 14 days ago 
Yes pretty much any decaying matter, including fish poop, is eaten by bacteria which then poop out nitrogen.

[–]offset_ 3 points 14 days ago 
So the world runs on poop?

[–]copperswallow 2 points 14 days ago 
Correct, this is the basis for Aquaponics (vs hydroponics that uses liquid fertilizers, etc). The fish poop becomes circulated through the system. bacteria grow (mostly) on media that the plants root into. The bacteria decompose the poop and make nitrogen. Nitrogen feeds the plants and the plants produce food from that.
Not a closed system, but an interesting one. I do this in my backyard. If it werent for pests (bugs) eating all my plants months ago, i'd be swimming in tomatoes.

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 14 days ago 
Um, completely irrelevant to the point in every manner.

[–]kerit 1 point 13 days ago 
Someone says N comes from fish. I say that it doesn't. How is that irrelevant?

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 13 days ago 
Because the comment you replied to was a reply to someone saying that it was possibly nitrogen lacking in hydroponics because there is no bacteria to fix it. The comment you replied to was simply saying that you can raise fish in the system and the nitrogen comes from the fish respiratory and digestive actions of the fish.
Then you come in and say that no, the fish don't fix nitrogen (nobody said they did) and that the nitrogen isn't really coming from the fish. This is a non sequitur. Yeah guess what nitrogen actually comes from stars. You don't get your vitamins from your food, you get them from stars. It's a silly non starter argument that is irrelevant to the point at hand.

[–]kerit 0 points 13 days ago 
So you are claiming that fish can fix nitrogen? Or what are you claiming?
The fish waste contains N, for sure, but I'm thinking that's because what the fish are being fed contains N.
But, I'm in the dirt ag industry, not aquaculture. I'd love to learn that fish fix N.

[–]VeggieWombat 1 point 14 days ago 
It's probably hydroponics, and there's no reason for the plants to lack anything...

[–]AnthAmbassador 1 point 14 days ago 
Nitrogen is supplied directly in fertilizers with NPK counts. I'm sure NPK are well represented as well as other micronutrients. What is likely not here is mycorrhizal relationships and a healthy micro ecology in general which is not the most important thing for a short term crop like greens.

[–]chozoart 11 points 14 days ago 
Yes, this is correct. I know that lettuce grown in hydroponics will taste bland compared to soil-grown lettuce. In order to match the flavor of soil-grown lettuce producers must add magnesium sulfate and adjust the pH levels accordingly.

[–]Mackabern 45 points 14 days ago 
how can things taste bland compared to fucking lettuce? that's like saying it tastes bland compared to water

[–]VeggieWombat 18 points 14 days ago

[–]Camtreez 1 point 13 days ago 
Does water in fact have a taste? Do H2O molecules bond to taste buds on the tongue? Or is it simply the lack of any taste that creates the "flavor" of water?
Also, could you say that water has the same flavor as fresh air?

[–]VeggieWombat 2 points 13 days ago 
Well, water may have a taste (honestly idk), but the variation in taste is due to mineral content, pH, possible contaminants, water treatment.

[–]squired 2 points 14 days ago 
Stop eating iceberg lettuce. Really, it's not good for you.

[–]i_make_throwawayz 5 points 14 days ago 
...
As much as I prefer other lettuces over iceberg, you have got to be out of your mind to think it isn't good for you.

[–]squired 1 point 14 days ago 
I didn't say it was bad for you, I said it wasn't good for you. It is basically like celery.

[–]i_make_throwawayz 1 point 14 days ago 
I realize that. But come on... celery, iceberg. Pick virtually any vegetable (basically anything not poisonous or that you're allergic to) and it is good for people.
Vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, fiber, water. How can it not be good for people?

[–]squired 1 point 14 days ago 
Alright, I'll admit I was too black and white. If it is iceberg or no lettuce, go with iceberg. It does have some nutrition, but every other cultivar is much better for you. If you don't like the taste of lettuce, romaine is a better alternative until you enjoy more robust and healthy options.

[–]Mackabern 1 point 13 days ago 
i don't. romaine doesn't have a taste either

[–]patrunic 1 point 14 days ago 
Not good for you? Please don't equate something being bad for you just because there are healthier or better options. Iceberg lettuce is good for you, there are just other things like rocket etc that are better. Still not bad.

[–]i_make_throwawayz 2 points 14 days ago 
He's only saying not good; so he either means bad or neutral. Above he says he doesn't mean that it's bad for you, so he must mean it is some sort of neutral food.
But it very obviously is a food that has things that benefit our bodies, so it's not some weird neutral thing.

[–]Nachteule 2 points 14 days ago 
That's not right. The taste can even be increased and changed with the color of the light. Yes that's right. You can make things taste more hot or sweet by changing the light spectrum. I saw a pretty long TV documentary about the whole indoor hydroponic farms.

[–]Spacejack_ 1 point 14 days ago 
Well, it stands to reason, if that flavor's coming from something in the soil, then you'd have to supply that same thing hydroponically.

[–]Ihwfarms 1 point 14 days ago 
After doing some research we opted for an aquaponic farm over a hydroponic one. We were growing some mixed greens this last grow season and the taste was great. There are so many advantages to aquaponics. We talk a bit about it on our website.

I don't buy the "bland hydro taste" thing. I've grown a number of vegetables and leafy green in hydro and always had a comparable if not superior taste to my soil grown stuff.

[–]welding-_-guru 1 point 14 days ago 
If you're doing hydro and not adding nutrients or adjusting your pH levels, you're a real shitty hydro grower. Indoor soil growers even do that and it's not nearly as sensitive or necessary as in a hrydo grow.

[–]jackal858 1 point 14 days ago 
I grow hydroponic lettuce at home using balanced nutrients and controlling the pH of the water reservoir. It produces some delicious lettuce.

[–]probpoopin 1 point 14 days ago 
Which is pretty much every hydroponic system. Some of the newer ones can even lock the pH in at optimal ranges. Advanced nutrients pH perfect is an example of this.

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 14 days ago 
Tbh do a blind tasting this just isn't true at all. By far the sweetest, tastiest romaine 8ve ever had was hydro.

[–]alonjar 1 point 14 days ago 
You're probably just thinking of micronutrients. Plants uptake a wide variety of substances in incredibly small amounts, which are often needed for various biological processes in your body (again, in micro amounts), but which are typically not used in hydroponic systems for reasons of practicality.

[–]SkyscraperFarms 1 point 14 days ago 
No. That is FUD. Anything and everything can be hydroponically introduced or soil mixed. The only real problem with this method is structural, i.e. Weight, load, and cost per floor vs. parcel overturn.

[–]mrtorrence 1 point 14 days ago 
Ya there's no soil, so you miss out on one of the huge ecosystem services that plants and their microbial partners provide in their natural environment (sequestering carbon in the soil). Plus you use lots of plastic and metal to build these food factories. They will have their niche but it would be far better for everyone if we practiced regenerative agriculture on a large scale and repaired our degraded ecosystems.

There is enough uranium on Earth to provide power to last us billions of years (using current technology).
While uranium is not an endless resource, nuclear power is, for all intents and purposes, considered sustainable (and clean). Even our sun will die, so if solar energy is considered sustainable, then nuclear energy is as well.

[–]phyrros 1 point 13 days ago 
Didn't account for seawater extraction (thx for the link). The same argument (minus seawater) could also be made concerning crude oil/gas.

[–]DMPDrugs 0 points 14 days ago 
There is uranium for a hundred years of suplying full power.

[–]neko_ceko 5 points 14 days ago* 
Where did you get that from?
http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html
Nuclear energy, assuming breeder reactors, will last for several billion years, i.e. as long as the sun is in a state to support life on earth.
and
He comments that lasting 5 billion years, i.e. longer than the sun will support life on earth, should cause uranium to be considered a renewable resource.
Basically, the sun will die sooner then we will use up all the uranium (unless we use inefficient systems). And that is JUST uranium. Thorium can be used in breeders as well, and there is 4 times as much of it in earth's crust as there is uranium.
Here's another source with more info:
http://www.daretothink.org/numbers-not-adjectives/how-long-will-our-supplies-of-uranium-and-thorium-last/
even in our extreme use scenario, we won’t run out of uranium.

[–]DMPDrugs 1 point 14 days ago 
The article meant that thorium reactors Create uranium as a product, not that naturally ocurring uranium will last that long

[–]neko_ceko 2 points 14 days ago 
Uh... Where does it say that? I see nothing in the article even similar to what you're saying.
The article explicitly states that he's using only uranium found in saltwater in his calculations. Add that to uranium and thorium we can extract from the crust, there's enough to last us long after the death of the sun.
Here's another shorter explanation with the same conclusion:

When it comes to nuclear anything people are fucking retarded. A pharmaceutical manufacturing company opened up not farm from where I used to work and a bunch of people were happy that new jobs, and money would be flowing into the city. One of the compounds they were going to produce was a medical radioisotope. All of a sudden people started flipping their shit and worrying that their babies would become deformed and that they would get super cancer.
Even after the company actively tried to explain that the process was safer than a bunch of day to day things and that the legal regulations to create the isotope were heavily regulated people still freaked the fuck out.
Nuclear anything and radiation are a scientific boogey man for the layman and unfortunately when it comes to funding their opinion matters.

[–]TDuffin 17 points 14 days ago 
It's funny because smokers are exposed to more radiation than people who work in nuclear power plants, but I bet you there were smokers in that demographic who were whining about the company.

[–]FlirtySanchez 4 points 14 days ago 
That's because cigarettes don't glow green. You have to consider that people who don't understand radiation don't realize that it's invisible. "This don't look like no nucular waste, my smokes don't come ina bright yellow barrel with a a-bomb sign onnit!"

[–]NoFap_Newb 1 point 13 days ago 
They understand it all too well. If some redneck smokes an extra 150 packs in a day, he'll notice for sure. If something goes wrong at the radioactive assembly plant, and he gets 150 times more radiation than the day before, he'll have no clue until someone comes by and tells him "Oh BTW you're dead, sorry about that."

The problem with nuclear anything, and the source of the layman's fear, is at the slightest mismanagement, it's Cherynobyl or Tokaimura or Fukushima or Goiania or any of the other nuclear disasters in the past 50 years, all over again. It's not like getting sick and you get better; radiation decay is irreversible and the lasting effects span generations and are mostly unknown. Areas around Fukushima have seen certain species of butterflies exhibiting different colors than ever seen before (among other mutations), and not because of evolution, but radiation. It's bigger and more dangerous than we understand, and people are right to fear it.

[–]imasturbaterightnow 4 points 14 days ago

Ok. I'll repeat myself.
NUCLEAR POWER IS VERY DANGEROUS AND SINGLE ACCIDENT COULD END LIFE ON EARTH.

safest source of power
Are you serious with this? You make retards look smart. Until they perfect the molten salt reactor, it's far too dangerous. Now go do some research and inform yourself.

[–]imasturbaterightnow 4 points 13 days ago 
Coal power kills more people every year, than every nuclear disaster put together.
And the current generation of nuclear power plants can't melt down.

[–]cC2Panda 2 points 14 days ago 
So increase your standards when choosing a location so it isn't on a fault, in a tsunami zone, or other easily predicted. Chernobyl and Tokaimura we're because total disregard for safety and precautions. I'm not familiar with Goiania so I won't speak on it. What we do know is that our current tech isn't viable for the future and is causing huge issues. People may not die explicitly because of the power source but longer droughts, harder winters, bigger storms, etc. kill people and will get worse according to many climate change reports. Solar doesn't work the further you get from the equator, wind and hydro, electric aren't viable every where either. We shouldn't put all our eggs in one basket, but if we can create reliable and safe nuclear energy then why shouldn't we use it.

[–]truthy_explanations 1 point 14 days ago 
ITER is projected to have a total construction cost of >€15bn, or about two years' worth of "Maximum effective effort" on that graph. It isn't an exact comparison, though, since the US ERDA presented this to the US Congress, and ITER is an international effort funded only in part by the USA.
I would advise everyone against interpreting this graph as applying to more than the USA. They were in the best position to fund fusion power research for decades, though, so it's not unreasonable to hold it against them, given that researchers presented a plan of action and the US turned it down.
Fusion power research in particular is a field where larger installations produce better results more easily. Since a viable reactor would provide so much extra energy per dollar invested, it would have been in everyone's best interests today if it had been funded more aggressively back in the '80s, even if the projected costs were doubled.

[–]Jlocke98 26 points 14 days ago

ya all you have to do is look at how the russian space program worked (aka very poorly with numerous fatalities before yuri gagarin actually survived the trip back) to realize they were generally incompetent at engineering complex systems. hardly an indicator of how nuclear engineering should be done. then again, japan kinda ruined it for the rest of us as well despite modern reactors being unable to have meltdowns

[–]TDuffin 3 points 14 days ago 
Japan's fault was also stupidity. They stuck the reactor in an area prone to earthquakes/tsunamis and then ignored it when it started going tits up. Better management of the reactor could've prevented it getting as fucked up as it is right now.

[–]Jlocke98 3 points 14 days ago 
IIRC they coulda flooded the reactor with a boric acid solution to shut down the reactor but chose not to. and yet ppl still fear nuclear reactor when human error has caused 2/3 reactor failures and 3 mile island was just a bad sensor design but still coulda been avoided if they just did a basic mass balance

[–]GalacticCow 2 points 14 days ago 
Fukushima had safety standards for tsunamis that work great if you're only dealing with tsunamis.
It also had safety standards for earthquakes that work great if you're only dealing with earthquakes.
Nobody put 2 and 2 together and said "maybe since tsunamis are caused by earthquakes, we should account for a situation where both happen at the same time". That's where the problems came from, IIRC.

[–]FlirtySanchez 2 points 14 days ago 
Which seems even more incompetent because they should have known. I've been to Japan 3 times over 20 years and experienced an earthquake each time.

[–]NSojac 1 point 13 days ago 
Japan's decision to put a reactor in an earthquake and tsunami was hardly "stupidity". I guarantee you a monumental amount of engineering effort went into assuring the reactor would safely shut down in the event of an earthquake and/or a tsunami. The problem was, what happened in Fukushima was a beyond-design-basis accident. The engineers design for a certain basis, a certain magnitude of earthquake or size tsunami, and if the actual event falls below that, the plant is safe. If you have an event that exceeds what the designers assumed, then all bets are off.

[–]kukookachu 2 points 14 days ago

[–]Jlocke98 1 point 13 days ago 
chernobyl was bad engineering. fukushima was caused excessive pride, 3 mile island was a display not being clear as to what it really meant (leading to people not noticing the leak until it was too late). the russians had the most systemic issues.

[–]Crudelita5 1 point 13 days ago 
And you are a nuclear engineer or other highly trained engineer capable of actually scrutinizing the engineering of the plant at chernobyl?

[–]Jlocke98 1 point 13 days ago 
i took a nuclear engineering course where we went over the cause/design of the nuclear reactors that have failed and i got 2 standard deviations higher score on all the exams IIRC. for the record, it was a dumb as fuck stress test that actually made the reactor fail but the plant design shouldn't have allowed them to shut off the failsafes in the first place and the protocols shouldn't have allowed them to do that stress test. the actual reactor type was graphite moderated which is the oldest type and based on the wiki page about it, has been the type of reactor that was involved in several minor accidents.
EDIT: in all fairness, i was being overly generalizing in my original comment

[–]shadotterdan 1 point 13 days ago 
Dude, Fukushima was like, barely hazardous, it was a worst case scenario and was still excellently handled with barely any radiation leaking. Compared to regular backround radiation, the amount released was minimal. You'd get a bigger amount from a move closer to the equator

I've accepted it. Governments are inefficient by nature.
It took our school (in germany) of 1000 students 3 years to complete the building of a cafeteria, they had to stop several times because there wasn't enough funding available in a single year.
Now? they're pulling whole housing complexes out of the ground basically over night because they need to. They use easily an additional 10 Billion per year for that. Nothing wrong with that, it's necessary, but funding something important and denying the same funding to something at least equally important is ridiculous.
Governments need to push innovation much harder. Having a budget that's at a solid zero at the end of the fiscal year might look great but if your infrastructure and education system fucks up, what's it worth?

The main problem (pretty much the only long term problem) is to keep a little stable sun on earth that will not burn through every known material. The solution right now is keeping it floating in a magnetic tube that has walls made of the most heat reasistant materials we know. But even then it will destroy them over time. So the distance between the artifical sun fire and the walls needs to be higher and the materials better but for that the whole system needs to be way bigger making it very very expensive. In theory we could already have nuclear fusion reactors, but in reality they are too expensive.
ITER is a small the blueprint for future bigger reactors
Several countrys already work on having a working commercial prototype and the first ones that may run for a while and produce more energy then it needs to start the fusion and keep it stable in one spot. They are called DEMO reactors that will be build until 2030 and start producting energy 2040. If they run the way planned, we could have fully commerical versions 10 years later. So when I am 78 years old, we may have nuclear fusion reactors powering our digital homes.

We rarely take into account how much petroleum is used in fertilizer, pesticides, and fuel to move the produce from rural farms. In addition, a lot of the implements used on farms run on petroleum-derived fuels and lubricants. This method saves a lot of fossil fuels.
Besides, as others have mentioned this method allows for almost limitless vertical expansion.
As a means to reduce fossil fuel dependence, this is a fantastic solution.

Late to the party, but we have the same type of factory here in Montreal. The Lufa Farms. They have 2 greenhouses installed on the flat roof of industrial buildings. It's kind of a pilot project for what urban agriculture could be. They re-use the heat coming from the rest of the building and re-use it during the winter. Add this to the heat from the greenhouse covering the whole roof and it requires very little energy.
It's like an enclosed ecosystem. All of the water is re-used. Bees are used to take care of pollination and produce honey. No pesticides or herbicides needed as there are no unwanted bugs.
It produces year round and every Tuesday evening you get what you ordered at a drop-off zone near you.

Would work well in a place with lots of water, hydro power and ports, like Quebec.

[–]lapagecp 5 points 14 days ago 
It uses less water than traditional growing. The entire point of this method is that it works well in places with little water.

[–]Euler007 1 point 14 days ago 
The hydro power regions of Quebec have lots of electricity and power, but extreme cold winters and poor overall conditions for agriculture (like around Baie Comeau). It could make economic sense.

[–]lapagecp 1 point 14 days ago 
I live an hours drive from the Hydro Quebec dam. I know the area well. I was not suggesting that it wouldn't work or wouldn't be a good idea for the area. I was addressing your comment. You stated three points.
"Lots of water" isn't needed. Its irrelevant at best.
"Hydro power" is great in that you have access to cheap power. So you have a point there.
"Ports" a big benefit of this type of farming is eliminating the need for long distance shipping. If you are thinking about loading the produce from a facility like this onto boats for transport I think you are going to have a hard time competing against more traditionally grown produce grown further away.

[–]Watcher_woman 9 points 14 days ago 
I know! We could use the sun to power indoor gardens to grow these plants!
Or we could just grow them the conventional way that uses the sun to grow them outdoors.

[–]Muckerjee 47 points 14 days ago 
I understand what you're saying, but this method requires considerably less water and is generally much more efficient. If we found a way to to use solar power more efficiently (or at least to a similar level as outdoor farming), combined with the controlled light cycling and improved water usage we'd be on to a winner.
Also it provides more opportunity for urban farming.

[–]AllWoWNoSham 25 points 14 days ago 
It also takes up less space, which is rather important in a country like Japan without lots of well... space

[–]captmarx 3 points 14 days ago 
It's rather important everywhere. Farmland fucks up the biosphere.

[–]Neshgaddal 1 point 14 days ago 
/u/Watcher_woman 's point is that using solar energy to power these things will not save any space. You need at least the same space to build solar collectors (since the plants have the same need for energy in- and outdoors), and that's at 100% efficiency. In the real world, the most efficient solar panels are at 45%. LEDs are pretty efficient, lets say 90%. That means just to power the lights, you need almost 2.5 times the space for solar panels plus whatever space the actual farm takes up. And then you're not yet powering the rest of the farm (like pumps and motors).

[–]Nubcake_Jake 2 points 14 days ago 
But the solar panels can absorb a larger spectrum of light for energy than what the lettuce would use, just green light.

[–]Icy207 3 points 14 days ago 
Actually they don't use green light, that's why they're green

[–]Neshgaddal 1 point 14 days ago 
Hmm, that's (kinda) true. Apparently, plants can only use 53% of the light, so they could use LEDs with their optimal spectrum. Still not saving any space, though. Even with these 45% efficiency panels (which are far from commercially available), you still need 1.3 times the space plus the space for the farm building itself.

[–]Nubcake_Jake 1 point 14 days ago 
But solar should also collect in gap areas where the plants would otherwise not be collecting light.

[–]AllWoWNoSham 0 points 14 days ago 
Why do people talk about solar panels as if they're the only source of clean energy?

[–]xiMbd03u1 4 points 14 days ago 
Water is an infinitely renewable resource in many locations. Saying that indoor, hydroponic growing is more efficient is meaningless unless you define the axis along which it is efficient. For example, it makes better use of space because it can be grown vertically, which might matter a lot on an island like Japan. But there is no world I can imagine in which growing lettuce in a building under lamps is more energy-efficient than growing lettuce in a field, under the sun and rain.

[–]squeamish 2 points 14 days ago 
If you replace 1 acre of crops with 1/10th acre of greenhouse and power that greenhouse with solar panels on the other 9/10ths of the acre then it would be more energy efficient.

[–]zilfondel 1 point 14 days ago* 
There are over 930 million acres of farmland in the US right now. That would require building ~93 million acres of indoor buildings... or ~4 trillion square feet. By comparison, the US currently has 87 billion square foot of commercial buildings space (~2 million acres).
Replacing all that farmland would require constructing 4,051,080,000,000 (4 trillion+) square feet of building space, at a rough construction cost of $150/sq ft would cost roughly $607,662,000,000,000 ($607.6 trillion), or 8 times higher than the entire world GDP ($76 trillion).
The building would have a footprint of... converting to metric... gives us 376,357 square kilometers, or roughly the size of Montana.

[–]squeamish 3 points 14 days ago 
...hence it being described as "energy efficient" rather than "economically sensible/possible" or "a reasonable idea."

[–]pj1843 1 point 14 days ago 
Energy efficiency can also be taken as the whole amount of energy used in the process, including the construction. Or we can just toss that up as a sunk cost and move on.

[–]lil_kreen 1 point 13 days ago 
I think you've forgotten that the racks can be ~20 shelves deep and we can make the building as tall as we like. Not to mention that pesticide and herbicide really isn't a thing at all in comparison for this. It's not like there's any worry about the cieling remaining open to allow our gravitic fusion sphere to send energy to a plant. I'll ignore any possible planting density gains from the nature of hydroponics and assume the same planting density as dirt farming. A .1 acre area, * 20 * 2 floors? Photovoltaics is easily approaching 4X the efficiency of photosynthesis (~20% vs ~5%) and can cover the whole surface without difficulty. That's leaving out the pie in the sky 100 floor skyscrapers some architects create from this design every so often as well.

[–]xiMbd03u1 1 point 14 days ago 
I am really skeptical of this, but I don't know for sure. Plants are less efficient than solar panels at converting solar energy to chemical energy, by a factor of about ten. But you've added a lot of intermediate steps when you go from solar panels to batteries to LED lights. You may not break even. Especially if you consider the whole-cycle cost of the solar panels, including manufacturing and installation and maintenance.

[–]dwarfarchist9001 1 point 14 days ago 
That is impossible. Plants are all ready using solar energy at the maximum efficiency they are capable of. Growing plants under LEDs instead of under the sun just adds extra steps which reduces efficiency because you lose energy with each step.

[–]squeamish 2 points 14 days ago 
Plants do not use the entire spectrum, so if the artificial lights output at a frequency more readily used by the plants then it is possible to produce more usable light.

[–]dwarfarchist9001 1 point 14 days ago* 
From what I found is that about 30% of the light energy is lost due to being outside of the plants ideal light spectrum. This means that vertical farming powered by solar panels would be on par with plant efficiency if solar panels were at least reached at least 70% efficiency.
Edit: this was assuming the efficiency of LEDs and the wiring to and from the solar panels was 100%. But it's not. In fact it is not even close, the efficiency of green LEDs is only 15%. So the solar panels would actually have to be 467% efficient (70%/15%) or LEDs would need to improve greatly.

[–]pilstrom 2 points 14 days ago 
The point of it is not energy efficiency, but efficiency of space and water, and actual production amount in comparison to traditional means while using less resources.

[–]avianrave 2 points 14 days ago 
If the outdoor area is pest ridden, then the indoor growing operation will use less pesticides. The indoor plants could end up being cleaner and more efficient than a giant outdoor monoculture.

[–]Sh00terMcDabbin 2 points 14 days ago 
I'm not asking this in a confrontational way, but what do you mean water is an infinitely renewable resource in many locations? I always thought (and this could very well be wrong, not claiming I'm right) that fresh water that would be used for growing plants could be eventually depleted to a certain extent. I know that we will always have some fresh water, but that overuse of water would eventually lead to not enough water for everything we need fresh water for.

[–]juandh 4 points 14 days ago 
You are correct, and it's the same issue with many renewable resources, there is only so much that is available at any given time.

[–]xiMbd03u1 2 points 14 days ago 
This depends heavily on the local ecosystem. If you look at California, they are in a massive drought. But the water they're not getting didn't disappear. It's not not falling on California any more. But you're right that my statement was a little flippant and deserves some criticism. If you look at a place like California, you could easily imagine a scenario where solar energy is cheap and water is expensive.

[–]Sh00terMcDabbin 1 point 14 days ago 
No criticism intended, I was just interested in learning more. Thanks for the info.

[–]zilfondel -2 points 14 days ago 
Its called the water cycle, the atmosphere continually desalinates and transports water from the ocean and deposits it onto the land via a process called "rain."

I understand what the water cycle is, you don't have to be smug about it.

[–]gluten_free_asbestos 1 point 14 days ago 
More efficient? It has benefits and I actually think there's a future for this technology for certain applications, but you're delusional if you think it's more efficient. Depending on the crop, the sun provides between 98-99% of all the energy inputs for a typical farm. Indoor agriculture throws that away in favor of electric lights. Solar panels are at best, 18-20% efficient, and the theoretical upper limits are between 30-50% depending on what sub-type of technology you're using. Ignoring other losses (transmission, electrical ballast etc), you need at least triple the growing area in solar panels to provide the same energy.
It might be more space efficient if you ignore the space needed to generate the electricity, and it might be more water efficient if you ignore that city water systems are vastly more wasteful than local irrigation (50% water losses are typical for a modern, we'll run municipal water system).
It has benefits, but efficiency is definitely not one of them.

[–]dwarfarchist9001 1 point 14 days ago 
Solar panels are only 15% efficient this means that for every acre of crops you would need 7 acres of solar panels or the equivalent from another energy source. Even if vertical farming required no water it still would be inefficient.

[–]Thenewme23 0 points 14 days ago

[–]mfball 1 point 14 days ago 
The point of the tech is to save space and water, and it's the energy cost that's prohibitive. If you could use solar to bring the energy cost down, you would maintain the water and space savings and it would be superior to conventional growing, assuming that nutrition and flavor are maintained with this method.

[–]Neshgaddal 1 point 14 days ago 
You're not saving any space if you use solar. Think about it; The energy that used to go directly in to the plants is now collected by solar panels, converted to electricity and then back in to light. Since solar panels aren't nearly 100% efficient (more like 30%), you need at least twice the space for solar panels than you need for a normal farm.

[–]showyourdata 1 point 14 days ago 
Or we could just grow them the conventional way that uses the sun to grow them outdoors.
What is it with you people? Indoor growing uses less energy, you can stack them, so more product on the same footprint, uses less water, can grow year around, uses a lot less energy.
Look. You can grow your lettuce on your flat acre, or you can grow your lettuce in a 20(or 10 story, or 50 story) story building on half an acre and power it by putting solar on the other half. Which would produce about 300Kw(plenty for run everything in the building). Assuming you use 1500 sq meters, leaving the other 550 sq meters for maintenance access.

[–]DuckyFreeman 1 point 14 days ago 
Can you uhhhh... can you show your data?
I'm not saying you're wrong, but I don't see how using a building full of lights and environmental control systems uses less energy than just letting the lettuce sit out in the dirt. And you've said it twice (at least) with some convinction in this thread, so I assume there's some numbers somewhere.

[–]q25t 1 point 14 days ago 
Not who you were talking to, but the other guy has the right idea.
The sun outputs light on a large spectrum with many different wavelengths, only some of these being useful for plants to grow. Solar panels can be used to absorb more energy from the sun than the plants would. Then LEDs are used to output light that the plants can use most effectively. That's the general idea here.

[–]DuckyFreeman 1 point 14 days ago 
But solar panels are only about 15% efficient, and the advantage of these buildings is a small footprint. Is it really more efficient to have only 10% of an area absorbing sunlight, and at only 15% efficiency, to then transmit the power at further losses, to re-emit the light? Are plants only using like 1% of sunlight to grow?

[–]q25t 1 point 14 days ago 
According to wikipedia (I'll find a better source if you want), the greatest possible energy conversion for plants is about 11%, although they ordinarily only absorb 3-6% if that. Compare that to the theoretical limit on solar panels coming in at 33.3%. Typical values for crop plants are between 1-2% (from the previous wiki) and typical solar panels are at about 11-15% right now. This makes solar panels at least 5 times more efficient space wise than plants. For every acre of solar panels you have then, you could make an acre of five-layer crop warehouse. As solar panels start to push towards that upper limit, this number will only get better.
The problem with this tech really isn't the energy, it's the fact that it can only currently grow very simple crops. This concept popped up earlier on /r/science I think and the impression I got was that lettuce is stupidly easy to grow using hydroponics or aquaponics as the nutrient requirements are comparatively simple compared to other plants. Something like corn or wheat may be quite a bit more complicated, but it ultimately looks like this tech may actually be incredibly useful in the future once the kinks have been worked out.
It also has the benefit of being an entirely controlled environment, which virtually eliminates the need for most pesticide/herbicide controls. Additionally, the controlled environment allows for collection of any excess fertilizer-type materials.

[–]DuckyFreeman 1 point 14 days ago 
So it sounds like the energy advantage is small, probably closer to break-even with transmission losses. Though there are many other advantages to make the concept a worthy alternative. Thanks for the numbers.

the problem was blight; a disease that killed a lot of different kinds of plants that was mutating to kill all the major crops. It's the same fungus that caused the Irish potato famine, but this one was affecting staple crops like Corn and Wheat. The thing that made Cooper realize he had to go was when he was seen some corn affected by blight. Corn is extremely important in the USA especially because it's essentially our #1 source of calories. Wheat had been killed off earlier as well which is important in European and developing nations because that's THEIR #1 source of calories.
So, blight could have infected an indoor facility as well, but you could have clean rooms, etc.
I don't think electricity was actually a big deal at the time

When what's-his-face went to the science lab, he was told that the blight is continuing to mutate and will eventually affect Corn, wiping out the last crop humanity is surviving on.

But it wouldn't have been the rest of humanity's lifetime. It would have been the lifecycle of the blight. It would have been considerably less expensive and less resource draining than, say, building a giant spacestation that was in need of a magical propulsion device to get it off the ground. Raise blight free crops in a clean environment. Make a lot of grow sites so contamination isn't disastrous. Continue testing the soil in the outside world, and when the blight is no longer a threat you can go about business as it was. You could maintain soil stability by planting species that aren't affected by the blight. Sure, it would probably involve doing things that, from an ecological standpoint, are akin to heresy. But if the blight has already made huge swathes of land barren, what do you really have to lose?
But, no. Instead, we'll pin all our hopes on figuring ou tthe magical formula that will allow us to bend space-time and move a ship the size of several cities (along with a fucking crop unit) across the Universe. That makes so much more sense.

[–]Dinkelbert 2 points 14 days ago 
And now imagine somehow the blight got on the ship and the new planet, and we go full circle.

[–]Kirboid 1 point 14 days ago 
Yeah the vault makes a lot of sense. I didn't think about the blight dying out on its own.

[–]wioneo 1 point 14 days ago 
alternative to living in a quarantined city
I just don't see what they really gained from space in the end.
Sure it looks cool to have a circley gravity thing, but people were talking about extinction. Aesthetics are not really a concern in that scenario.

[–]Kirboid 2 points 14 days ago 
My thought is just that humans live better when they don't have to be inside 24/7 and the planet was (probably) the fastest way to let future generations live their lives in a more natural environment.
But as a comment above explained you could also accomplish this by waiting out the blight's lifetime in a vault while you prepare crops.

The worst thing about that diet would be the loss of the novelty of corn-accented poop.

[–]Hamno 0 points 14 days ago 
Then why the massive dust storms? Seemed more like a drought/global warming issue as opposed to a blight. Or was this just a movie trope?

[–]patchbag 6 points 14 days ago 
When the plants die, they don't help the ground hold moisture. The ground gets dry and wind blows the dust around.

[–]fdsdfg 6 points 14 days ago 
I figured it was the same thing as the 30s, overexploitation of the soil due to the lack of crop diversity.
The dust bowl of the 30s wasn't just about the drought, it led to a lot of agricultural reforms like contour farming and changes to how we plow.
I figured that in Interstellar, we had learned these lessons, but due to our reliance on corn, we were forced back into the same short-sighted philosophy.

[–]SmegmataTheFirst -1 points 14 days ago 
Why we were doomed if the blight hit the corn. Why we didn't eat animals that ate things we don't eat. Even if traditional stock animals are too difficult or inefficient to feed the world, there's always mealworms, or earthworms or something. Why not breed bugs or bacteria that eat blight? It's organic, so something has to be able to eat it, solving the CO2 problem. Lotsa plot holes in that movie.

[–]Bufferton 4 points 14 days ago 
Those aren't plot holes.
A plot hole would be them showing such bacteria, that they know about such bacteria, and for some reason not using it. If they never tell you in the movie that it is possible that they can breed a bug or bacteria to 'eat blight', there is no logical inconsistency from them not doing so.
They just didn't think it a good use of screen time to go over all the things that were tried and failed. Again, not a plot hole, they just didn't directly give you answers, you have to infer them on your own. See http://unrealitymag.com/movies/why-we-need-to-give-plot-holes-a-rest/
Anyway, they could always just wave your objections away, saying something like 'The blight mutates too fast' or 'We accidentally made the blight and now we can't stop it'.

[–]OrangeredValkyrie 1 point 14 days ago 
They had blight because they didn't want to alienate the anti climate change crowd.

[–]ericmm76 3 points 14 days ago 
I thought they said there would be no oxygen before there was no food?

[–]proboardslolv3 6 points 14 days ago 
I think it was nitrogen. And the statement was that Blight breathes nitrogen, not oxygen, making earth a very habitable place for it

[–]vaclavhavelsmustache 2 points 13 days ago 
I think they said something like "the last generation to starve to death will be the first generation to suffocate"

[–]Ciserus 3 points 14 days ago 
I never understood how finding another planet was a solution. Once they moved planets, wouldn't they need to bring the same food crops with them (and therefore the blight)?
Or if it were possible to transport healthy seeds to the new planet, then it would also be possible to grow them in isolation on Earth in an enclosed space like this. And a hell of a lot easier than transporting the entire population of the planet across the galaxy, I think...

[–]Valdrax2 1 point 14 days ago 
It's the same fungus that caused the Irish potato famine
Not it's not. It's a fundamentally alien organism. It attacks across the entire plant kingdom, regardless of how many million years of divergent evolution there is between many of our major plant crops, and it somehow respires on nitrogen instead of oxygen. (No, this is not what nitrogen-fixing bacteria do, by the way.)
Whatever it is, it's fundamentally unlike all known life. I'm not sure why NASA is so sure in the movie that the wormhole creators are benevolent when something as alien as the Blight is running around.

[–]wioneo 1 point 14 days ago 
What were they eating in the space station? And why could they not have eaten that in a structure (such as a space station) specifically designed to have a durable barrier right on Earth?

[–]crow1170 1 point 9 days ago 
The atmosphere is changing. Who knows what will remain durable in such an environment, or if solar panels can still collect through it, or whether there will even be an appreciable wind system?
Counter argument: Thorium reactor on the moon would be a better plan b.
Counter counter argument: that wormhole wasn't there before. Someone put it there. They could easily destroy us, so we will eventually have to submit to their will anyway. Maybe by doing it sooner we can save more people.

[–]IkmoIkmo 56 points 14 days ago 
The only thing is, they don't seem to eat very much lettuce.
They use lettuce because it's easy to grow and experiment with. People then look at it and think we can replace our food system with this tech.
What people forget is that lettuce looks like a bunch of food, but really is a bunch of water with a tiny spec of food. A full head of lettuce has about 50 calories. Daily caloric intake of normal human beings is about 2500 calories, or the equivalent of 50 heads of lettuce. So it looks like this is really cool, but really they're just taking a ton of LED lights and a bunch of water, and turning it into a bunch of water and a little bit of food while wasting a lot of electricity they could get from the sun, to save water that isn't actually lost but simply gets recycled in normal agriculture.

[–]Rephaite 9 points 13 days ago 
to save water that isn't actually lost but simply gets recycled in normal agriculture.
That sounds somewhat misleading to me. Sure, the water isn't destroyed. It goes somewhere.
But that somewhere doesn't have to be somewhere accessible to the farmers who used it, so it can indeed be lost.
California's Central Valley has been bleeding water. It is in the middle of an intense drought, not having enough water to sustain all its people and agriculture.
This occurs despite the existence of a water cycle: some of the water is leaving the valley and going places un or less accessible to valley farmers.

[–]togaman5000 646 points 14 days ago 
Right. It's a setup that trades water usage for energy usage, which might work better in the future once we sort out renewable energy and reduce water consumption.

[–]HarithBK 355 points 14 days ago 
i think the biggest reason this sort of system is going to be picked up in the future is the space saving factor you can stack layer and layer of crops in a very small space. that is why you see this sort of thing beaing devloped in japan since space it allready at such a premium that it is worth the investment in technology.

[–]Sevlins 169 points 14 days ago 
Agriculture space has not as of yet been important. The problem is more where you can and can't grow food, and income distribution making poor areas unable to buy the food they need.
That said, with climate change looming, a farm that ignores outside seasons and climate entirely is gonna be pretty nice.

Also, who cares if they dont need but just WANT more agriculture, it still means that space does in fact matter.

[–]Chino1130 10 points 14 days ago 
I have an indoor hydroponic farm in my basement that can have 260 heads of lettuce growing at any given time. I make money hand over fist at farmers' markets during the winter months. I can charge $5-$6 a head and people don't even think twice about paying for it.

[–]sisterbliss 1 point 14 days ago 
Neat!
How long does it take for you to grow that many heads of lettuce? Does the whole operation cost much? I'd guess with that many heads of lettuce you need a fair sized basement and a decent lighting rig..

[–]Chino1130 6 points 14 days ago 
I grow all of it in a space that's 10' long, 4.5' wide, and 8' high. Really not all that big all things considered. It cost me about $1400 to get everything I needed in working order. I bought a bunch of used NFT channels and built all of the racks and stuff out of 2x4s.
All of the lettuce is at different stages. It takes between 5 and 6 weeks to grow a head from seed. I have 260 heads of lettuce all in one of six weeks of development. I aim for 45 fresh heads per week. When I harvest fresh lettuce, I plant 45 more seeds. The following week I'll harvest the next 45 that are ready and plant 45 more new seeds... if that makes sense.
Ideally I'd love to one day take out a quarter million dollar loan, lease some old factory space, and export a few thousands fresh pieces of produce per week.

[–]sisterbliss 2 points 13 days ago 
That's much smaller than I imagined!
Do you grow anything else besides lettuce? What are the costs like in terms of electricity? If you're selling for $4-5 it sounds like you could be making a decent amount per lettuce.

[–]Chino1130 3 points 13 days ago 
I don't. I'd like to one day. I grow Butterhead lettuce mainly. Electricity has gone up by about $45 per month. That factors in water pumps and heat mats.

Not really an issue. Israel has shown the ability to grow crops in the Negev. Many of Florida's tomato operations are basically small pots of soil in fields of sand.
Farming practices are much more important. It was bad farming practices that led to the dust bowl, and behind Indonesia's current problems.

[–]shadotterdan 2 points 14 days ago 
I think one good thing about indoor growing though would be the capability to grow food outside of your climate zone.

[–]Pressondude 2 points 14 days ago 
The problem is more where you can and can't grow food, and income distribution making poor areas unable to buy the food they need.
This is in no way cheaper, though. It's a massive expenditure of energy, plus the construction and harvesting is labor intensive. Shipping is much cheaper, the problem is that the urban poor often lack stores in their area that carry said produce. It's not so much that the cost of transport makes the food prohibitively expensive, it's that there's no distribution infrastructure. Convenience stores don't sell veggies.

[–]Sevlins 1 point 14 days ago 
I didn't suggest this technology solved those problems, I was just highlighting that those are the primary challenges the hungry of the world face.
This technology is only really beneficial for northern rich countries relatively speaking.

On top of the that, it's only beneficial to the richer parts of said countries. This technology isn't going to eliminate food deserts.

A fuck lot actually. If 5% of farm land was converted into natural ecosystems, that'd be five million more square miles of wilderness.
It's hard to impress upon people the impact just a little bit of natural biodiversity can do. It is far ranging and systemic and affects everyone. The faster we can ecologically move to vertical farming the better. Probably won't be in my lifetime, though.

[–]Sevlins 3 points 14 days ago 
Not a lot. Forest locks up a certain amount of carbon, and then stops absorbing it. Once the trees are grown, that's about your optimal peak since dead trees have their carbon released by decomposers.
The major source of carbon in our atmosphere is fossil fuels. Before we started digging it up and venting it into the atmosphere that carbon was effectively out of the climate in all ways.
In order to reverse this, we'd need to grow trees and bury them basically. And we're talking a lot of trees.

Except shipping is very cheap.
If you fill a shipping container full of tshirts and ship them from China to the USA, the shipping cost is less than $0.01 per shirt.
Shipping in bulk, even for things like vegetables which require faster shipping and controlled environments, is so cheap that it would be cheaper to grow lettuce elsewhere and ship it to japan than it would be to pay the power costs of this setup.

[–]MrjonesTO 63 points 14 days ago 
I ship produce for a living. The cost of a refrigerated truck from California or Washington states varies by season. Shipping a 40lb box of apples is between $6-$7 for example when you break it down by truckload. When you consider that wholesale cost on that 40lb box of Granny Smith's is about $25, the cost of shipping is not cheap.

[–]barsoap[🍰] 8 points 14 days ago 
Shipping apples has to be an estimated ten thousand times more easy than salad heads.
I do know for a fact that it's cheaper (and more friendly to the climate) to import New Zealand apples to Europe than to have them in cold storage over here when they aren't in season, but you really, really cannot do either with salad heads.
And tomatoes are even more extreme, though you can make concentrate out of tomatoes which is what everyone who doesn't grow them in their garden or absolutely needs whole ones should do: First off you get better taste because the producers can use strains that taste well but don't transport well (tomatoes are fragile as fuck), secondly producing concentrate produces water as "waste", which the producers, which sensibly are in hot and thus generally arid locations, can use to water the next batch, thirdly concentrate is the most efficient form to transport tomatoes no matter how robust (and bad-tasting) the original tomatoes are.

[–]JoshCantSwim 2 points 14 days ago 
It should also be noted that it's usually "expensive" because so much freight is coming out of the west coast that truckers can refuse every call to them about a load. And isn't produce freight usually through a broker adding $500/$1000 to the cost?

[–]MrjonesTO 5 points 14 days ago 
Again, depends on the season. Right now there is not enough product coming out of Cali and trucks will not refuse a load.
Brokers (such as myself) are necessary to both regulate the market and provide loads for smaller trucking companies that can't do business directly with the Walmarts and Costcos of the world. The broker does add some 5-10% cost to the transportation cost but semi insignificant to the overall cost.

[–]Nootronics 10 points 14 days ago 
Im not trying to call you stupid. But 'not cheap' compared to what? Growing those apples under electric light? Then 25$ is damn cheap in comparison

[–]damnocles 16 points 14 days ago 
You're missing the point. He's saying that $7 in shipping is a very high percentage of a total $24 box of apples (~30% increase in total cost in shipping alone), refuting the poster he replied to. Thus it is still inefficient financially to ship perishable goods and also good for us to look into always supply avenues for food.

[–]MrjonesTO 5 points 14 days ago 
Correct. Also, this stacked method of growing is only viable for commodities like lettuce, carrots, berries, etc. Tree fruit would require much much more space if similarly cultivated.

[–]g00dis0n 1 point 13 days ago 
Note to self: trees can't be grown and stacked indoors

[–]Nootronics 2 points 14 days ago 
I think you are the one missing the point. Shipping perishable goods is way way cheaper than all known alternatives. A 30% price increase is A LOT cheaper than the extra cost of growing it under electrical light locally.

[–]nmhunate 1 point 14 days ago 
How many apples are in a box?

[–]falk225 1 point 14 days ago 
Nope. It was not asserted that shipping is cheap, but rather that it is cheaper than power costs of alternative. Reply stated that shipping costs are NOT cheap but did not compare them to the power costs of alternative indoor setup, which are so far unknown, thus not refuting jack diddly.

[–]Nootronics 1 point 14 days ago 
Thank you for actually understanding the issue.

[–]Rephaite 3 points 14 days ago* 
That's 62 about 16 cents shipping per pound of apple.
A cabbage weighs 2-3 pounds, for $1.24 to $1.86 32 to 48 cents in shipping costs at the same rate per pound as he described.
At 10k cabbages a day, that would be $12,400 to $18,600 $3,200 to $4,800 a day in cost.
Do you really think they spend 4.5 to 7 1.17 to 1.75 million dollars on electricity a year, to equal that?
Phrased another way, do you think it takes more than a dollar's quarter's worth of LED lighting to grow a single cabbage?
EDITED to correct math after my earlier misreading of shipping prices from above.

[–]Time4Red 6 points 14 days ago 
Phrased another way, do you think it takes more than a dollar's quarter's worth of LED lighting to grow a single cabbage?
If it take 70 days to grow a cabbage with 2.5 watts of LEDs on 12 hours a day, then it would take exactly $0.25 to grow a single cabbage if you pay $.12 per kilowatt-hour. I think you underestimate how much electricity is really involved.

Y'all need a healthy education about how expensive it is to maintain a facility under such conditions.
The ventilation, humidity control, temperature control, etc. is not something to scoff at. So I'm not exactly sure why we're focusing on the amount of electricity required to run a "few" LEDs.
I'm probably replying to the wrong person, since I'm sure there's a valid reason for why you calculated all that.

Shipping costs way way way way less than growing apples indoors under electric light. Your ignorance of the costs involved is complete.

Yeah... I'm disappointed that Mr Musk doesn't want to personally work on the hyperloop, because I think that says something about how successful he think it will be, at least in the short term.
I think if we can work out the engineering hurdles, it's probably the most ideal form of transit, but it's something that maybe won't come into play for many more decades.
In order for it to work well, we'd have to basically blaze straight paths between major cities, and have hyperloop systems key into light rail transit hubs, which kinda means that in order for it to work, we have to redesign cities themselves... big hurdle.
My hope is that early trials are fairly successful, and they start building new hubs that are more energy efficient, easier to walk/bike around and that young professionals and companies that want young enlightened professionals will flock to centering their lives in those hubs, and they will leave the old centers in the dust.

[–]WaywardTraveller 2 points 14 days ago 
So very true. It's cheaper for us to ship chickens to China to have them processed, then ship back to North America than it is to process it here.
Think about that for a second.

[–]platypeep 1 point 14 days ago 
Yes. Also UV LEDs are pretty damn expensive when you look at dollars per watt.

[–]jimethn 1 point 14 days ago 
Your example doesn't support the point you're making. The 1c per Chinese shirt anecdote is an illustration of how cheap it is to ship things across the ocean using cargo ships. It's actually used to describe how it can be cheaper to ship something across the ocean than across the country because cargo ships are such economically efficient as far as transport. You're extending it to say it's cheap to ship things across the country, which is actually the exact opposite of the conclusion that anecdote supports.

[–]londons_explorer 2 points 14 days ago 
Local trucking is more expensive than bulk cargo shipping, sure, but you need the trucking anyway to get produce to and from retailers.

[–]UnitedDC_kicker 1 point 14 days ago 
That's because the environmental cost has not been factored in. Those shipping boats produce huge amounts of air pollutants including co2

Japan's got tons of agricultural space, and their population has been falling for quite some time. To put it in perspective, India has a higher population density than Japan does, by about 20%, but nobody seems to think they're out of farmland.

[–]Ryganwa 8 points 14 days ago 
That's just based on overall land area though. You have to take into account topography. A whopping 73% of Japan is mountainous, while India has much much more of a percentage of land suitable for farming.

[–]XBebop 3 points 14 days ago 
Japan has a pretty decent amount of farmland, but it's almost all small-scale farming. I live a few minutes' bike ride from said farmland, so I know from experience.
Basically, Japan has enough farmland to be self-sufficient in a few crops, like rice and possibly wheat. However, it just doesn't have the room for much else. There are cabbage farms, corn farms, etc. here, but they're tiny.

[–]showyourdata 3 points 14 days ago 
Only 20% of Japan land is suitable for cultivation, and it's all being used, so I'm not sure where you get ' tons of agricultural space'.
FYI:
Japan has 336 people per square kilometer.
India has 382 persons per square kilometer
So not hugely different, and population center density vs cultivable area is another factor.

[–]Brio_ 8 points 14 days ago 
India is also about 80% shit hole.

[–]inteuniso 2 points 14 days ago 
That's what UK wants you to think.

[–]x0mi07 1 point 14 days ago 
The thing is, a majority of Japan's land mass makes it difficult for cities to spread and grow (lots of mountains and not enough arable land), hence more people live in concentrated areas. Not sure if this is still correct, it was something I read in a geography book when I was ten.

[–]squeamish 1 point 14 days ago 
Why do cities need arable land to grow? Wouldn't the opposite be true, arable land would be valuable enough limit city growth/sprawl?

[–]Creshal 2 points 14 days ago 
Flat, not too dry or wet, land is as good for building cities as it is for farming. You can build cities into mountain ranges, but that's even more expensive.

[–]squeamish 1 point 14 days ago 
True, but there is flat, non-wet/dry land that isn't arable, the two aren't interchangeable.

[–]Creshal 1 point 14 days ago

[–][deleted] 1 point 14 days ago 
More people starve to death in India than all of Africa combined. If no one thinks they are out of farmland it is either because they are ignorant or they think the problem is really overpopulation. Which it is.

[–]dendybarthemottled 3 points 14 days ago 
As with any other starvation crisis on a large scale, including the Ethiopian crisis in the 80s/90s, it's not a lack of food in country, it's a lack of proper distribution. I mean if there are sacks of food easily available in the hellish slum of Dharavi, then there is food available, but it's not getting to those who need it for whatever reason, probably economic reasons.

[–][deleted] 1 point 14 days ago 
In India there is no starvation crisis. That implies acuity. There is a starvation way of life.
You could easily argue that the economics that cause in equal distribution of food are calls themselves by overpopulation and the resultant devaluation of labor. In India this is certainly the case as human life is incredibly cheap. That is overpopulation.

Hm. California has a huge agriculture industry but is facing a massive water crisis... But has tons of solar power...

[–]peterkeats 23 points 14 days ago 
Well, it has tons of sun, not solar power. Farmers use the solar power you're thinking of to grow plants traditionally.

Turn all those farms into a solar plants, smack a farming skyscraper in the middle of it and it might just out produce what California is producing now, especially if you add in some nuclear plants.

[–]weldawadyathink 2 points 14 days ago 
Please don't do nuclear power in California. I am all for nuclear power, and I live in California, but don't. At Bodega Bay, there is a hole in the ground, about 20 feet deep. The government was planning on building a nuclear power plant. A fault line splits the hole in half perfectly. Really bad idea. If you do nuclear power, do it at the Nevada border at least. But please, no nuclear for San Andreas fault.

It can be done with just solar, you don't need nuclear plants.

[–]shufflebuffalo 0 points 14 days ago 
It would be very helpful with the water heavy practice of growing alfalfa as feedstock, but the major crops that are heavy water users in California are tree nuts, grapes, and avocados, which cannot be cultivated in this manner. California needs to change the crops being grown to more drought tolerant crops, but guess what... there's more money in growing those water demanding crops. Its a shitty situation that is going to end poorly financially, socioeconomically, and environmentally.

The cost of electricity is really the only limiting factor in most things.

[–]togaman5000 40 points 14 days ago* 
Think of it in terms of environmental impact. Current farming practices in the Midwest use a ton of water, but relatively little human-produced energy. As our ability to produce renewable energy increases but our available (relative) water decreases, shifting to this system works better. We move from water-limited agriculture to electricity-limited agriculture.
Edit: Slight clarification on energy vs electricity

[–]igerner 10 points 14 days ago 
I wonder how much energy is currently consumed by the production of agricultural chemical products. Making fertilizer is energy-intensive, right?

[–]togaman5000 3 points 14 days ago 
1/3rd, is the number I'm finding. Yes, it's high, but hopefully someone more qualified can weigh in on whether or not it's possible to move to a more efficient fertilization method.

[–]Nyxian 2 points 14 days ago 
The bulk of the fertilizer used is N P K - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium. Inefficiencies are primarily loss through leaching, runoff, and non-optimal ratios of fertilizer.
Leaching loss is regular rain and irrigation water chemically moving the fertilizer away from where it is needed, typically down deeper into the soil below the rootzone of the crop. It isn't a huge loss, but unneeded. Depending on the soil properties, it may be reclaimed by a rotation crop later, or it may be lost forever.
There is also runoff, where the fertilizer is physically removed and washed downstream. This is normally from a very heavy rain shortly after an application, and you have soil and mobile nutrients being moved by the water - typically to somewhere you don't want them, and often in toxic concentrations.
Non-optimal ratios result from the wide range of soil types one field will have, both from having different starting levels of fertilizer, different soil physical properties (sandy, silty, clayey) and different chemical properties which will change the availability.
Many crops have "gluttonous" tendencies, where the uptake of a certain nutrient is higher if the amount is higher, but there is minimal to no yield benefit from that. However, when you apply fertilizer you typically apply one set amount across a field, which is based off of a result on the low end of the spectrum. While there are new technologies to make this more efficient, typically you'll have at least some loss to gluttony.
With that said, practically every loss I just described can be mitigated with hydroponics. This isn't to say in any way I think it is viable currently, but it will certainly be more fertilizer efficient than current techniques, but not nearly as much as the water benefit. Right now fertilization efficiencies of roughly 50% are common, though the range is fairly wide.

[–]togaman5000 2 points 14 days ago 
As a future technology, every benefit you mentioned is more than relevant.

[–]shufflebuffalo 2 points 14 days ago 
Lots of work is being funded to look at rhizobia, i.e. nitrogen fixing bacteria that colonize the roots of plants. They actively fix gaseous nitrogen into ammonia which can be used as a nitrogen source for plants. Regardless, it's a more attractive option than the energy intensive Haber process.
However, work for engineering these microbes for fixing vast amounts of nitrogen for fertilizer is... less than promising.

[–]bn1979 8 points 14 days ago 
Most places in the US are not lacking water by any means.

[–]foreverstudent 5 points 14 days ago 
A good chunk of the Midwest relies on semi-renewable water sources. The Ogallala Aquifer is being drained much faster than it is being replenished.

[–]togaman5000 4 points 14 days ago 
For now, yes. This is clearly something that may be a better choice in the future, but isn't now.

[–]bn1979 2 points 14 days ago 
Lettuce is a pretty shitty example TBH. You can take the core from a head of lettuce, stick it in a bowl of water by a window, and it will regrow. Unfortunately, lettuce provides about as much nutritional value as the water it's grown in.
Now if they could just figure out how to grow sirloin and bacon....

[–]JdH-AU 1 point 14 days ago 
Solar power is the future. I can imagine these things being coupled with solar panels and operating fully off the grid. I guess that would still pose a challenge in winter, unless you add options for turbines etc.

[–]_StingraySam_1 1 point 14 days ago 
To put food in a field your fixed costs are machinery, labor, maintenance, storage, taxes, rents and to some extent irrigation. Agricultural land is very cheap, and farm implements are relatively cheap to the amount of land they can efficiently work.
In contrast vertical farming could easily eat up all of those costs in property taxes and the cost of land. Even if there are tax subsidiaries you're going from cents a Sq ft to tens to even hundreds of dollars a Sq ft depending on where it is located.
Then you have to develop the vertical farming facility which would get well into the millions of dollars just for the construction of the building. Not to mention the long development process to pass through city legislation, food safety laws (since it's a new form of food growing) and improvements to the surrounding infrastructure to support its energy and water usage.
After just building the facility you still have to employ workers which definitely aren't going to be as cheap as farm labor. You have to store the food and you have to find a way to distribute it. All this for pretty low demand foods. You can't do wheat or corn. You seem to limited foods like lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes etc. Which will have a more variable demand in comparison to crops like wheat, corn, alfalfa etc.
I think there are large number of limiting factors when you compare it to agricultural techniques used today in the United States. Especially when consider these fact that water usage is close to free for a lot of agricultural areas in the US.

When calculating the energy costs, it only takes few years to amortise the cost of the LEDs, at least in southern Germany.

[–]snuxoll 3 points 14 days ago 
Even then, not having to change incandescent bulbs every 3 months or deal with properly disposing the mercury in CCFLs is worth it.

[–]beefpancake 2 points 14 days ago 
Germany also has incredibly high electricity costs compared with the U.S. - at $0.08/kwh (my rate), LED bulbs are a tougher sell.

[–]MeisterEder 3 points 14 days ago 
Oh wow, yeah we pay around 0.25-0.32 €/kwh IIRC, that's around 0.27-0.35 $. Though that would've been significantly more a few months back as the Euro is incredibly weak nowadays.

[–]togaman5000 1 point 14 days ago 
Fluorescents don't use much more electricity than LEDs, but are significantly cheaper in the US

[–]MeisterEder 2 points 14 days ago

[–]showyourdata 2 points 14 days ago 
So your lighting cost is , at least, 1/10 per month and you aren't going to replace them as often. YOu should be praising them.

[–]togaman5000 1 point 14 days ago 
Purely joking before, I'm more than happy with my LEDs. The first pack I thought was expensive, the rest just made sense.

[–]Impulse33 1 point 14 days ago 
Did you buy just regular LED bulbds from home depot or something? I'd be surprised if those last a lifetime. Otherwise, where did you get your setup?

[–]togaman5000 1 point 13 days ago 
Yeah, Cree bulbs from Home Depot

[–]scrovak 4 points 14 days ago 
Then why not do this somewhere there exists bou tiful energy but low water, like the desert in the midwest, or sub-Saharan Africa? Both places ideal for solar farms, not well endowed with a whole lot of fresh water, and both would benefit greatly from the fresh food.

[–]togaman5000 3 points 14 days ago 
The economics still aren't beneficial. The driving force behind this technology would be that the cost savings in water outweigh the cost deficits in energy. However, given that water is still so cheap and plentiful vs. energy production in the areas you've mentioned, it still won't come out ahead, if that makes sense

[–]j1e0 4 points 14 days ago 
Another factor to consider is the money saved in pesticides/herbicides and the increased value of food that has never been treated with any. I am curious to know if this farm in Japan has had any issues with bug/weeds getting inside.

[–]showyourdata 2 points 14 days ago 
what cost deficits?
No herbicides = less energy.
No pesticides = less energy
Waste is down to 10% = less energy
100 fold increase in productivity = less energy per head.
2.5 times more produce = less energy
year around production = less energy.
Most light the falls on a field is not used by the crop. Solar uses the light more effectively and efficiently than a field.
For every sq. meter you give to solar means, at least 10 sqr meters of vertical farming you can power.

[–]togaman5000 1 point 14 days ago 
You're only discussing relative changes in cost, e.g. percentages. Adjust a few by 1000% and the others by -1000%, you're still not guaranteed a net-zero.

[–]scrovak 1 point 14 days ago 
I'm talking places like the African villages that don't have cheap, plentiful water.

Generally speaking they also won't have the power to run a facility like this. Ultimately though, they'll get renewable power while water remains limited.

[–]morriscey 3 points 14 days ago 
the energy expended isn't as huge of a difference as you may think. the MAIN barrier to hydroponics is you need a facility to do it in. A farm, you need a cheap barn and a field as your starting point. Hydroponics you need an enclosed semi-modern building to house all your crap.

[–]togaman5000 1 point 14 days ago 
Totally open to the idea, but from what I recall the articles when this came out mentioned the extreme increase in energy requirements with the setup. I hate to put the burden of proof on you, but any decent resources available?

[–]morriscey 2 points 14 days ago 
Not off the top of my head I don't, sorry. If I was still running Hydroponicsdictionary.com I'd have some stuff at my fingertips, but alas we sold the site years ago. there is still some good stuff on there if you feel like digging though.
Depending on the original articles publishing date I may be able to make my point seem more credible to you though.
Hydroponics have long used High pressure sodium and Metal Halide bulbs to get close to the correct light spectrum for the different stages. These bulbs take a MASSIVE amount of electricity to run, and run hot enough to melt flesh. They also need to be replaced frequently.
by switching to LEDs there would be a reduction of power usage in the neighborhood of between 75 - 50% depending on the lights used. Further power is saved by not needing to run an AC unit or fans to deal with the heat produced by the older filament type bulbs. The LEDs cost more initially, but a single LED panel will easily pay for itself over its useful lifetime, over replacing bulbs. You also end up using less water, because the old school bulbs will cause a ton of evaporation with the heat and IR light emitted.
compared to a normal outdoor farm, the energy increase is absolutely going to be exponential (even with LEDs) - because soil and sunlight use no energy - and you still need to use all the other energy consuming equipment, but I would wager the actual energy cost in dollars isn't as significant as that article had you believe. You also end up with a better product that can sell for more, with no pesticides used, and less spoilage.
While actual energy usage does indeed go up significantly, the biggest barrier to entry is going to be the high start up cost.

[–]togaman5000 2 points 14 days ago 
You've added more facts to this conversation than I could, and that's awesome. I agree with your conclusion, and I think it aligns with the idea that this setup trades water for energy, which we'll need in the future.

[–]morriscey 2 points 14 days ago 
The beautiful part about hydroponics is, you can even do it with a net-zero power consumption. Skip the lights, and setup your pumps on a battery and solar panel system, and away you go. Maybe it isn't super useful for you or I, but holy crap would this setup be awesome in a place with no power.

[–]togaman5000 2 points 14 days ago 
Develop for a place with no power and you'll be better situated for a place with at least some power. The sooner I can tell a computer "Tea, Earl Gray, hot" the better

[–]Aldun13 2 points 14 days ago 
It also trades energy useage for space.

If Lockheed and other orgs are correct in their predictions that Fusion power generation is just a decade or two away then energy would not be a prohibitive resource as it would be clean and virtually limitless.

[–]jemyr 2 points 14 days ago* 
Trades water usage, pesticide usage and fertilizer usage, (probably water contamination, biodiversity disruption, and soil contamination and air contamination--- think Salton Sea), for energy usage (and all the side effect contaminations of energy usage) EDIT: and also construction, field vs building. But then controlled environment: crop loss due to fluctuations vs no loss.
Interesting which one is more preferable.
There might also be something to be said for probable increased automation. Food production productivity is a basic building block of civilization. The fewer people involved in producing food, the more people who can specialize in doing something else.

[–]eneka 2 points 14 days ago

[–]TonyzTone 2 points 14 days ago 
I truly believe that developments can be made fairly quickly to make it not only eco-friendly but also profitable.
Using an aquaponics system with the right LED wavelengths and lighting periods, exact plant and fish nutrient balance, in a building that is solar powered and efficiently designed to moderate temperature (well-sealed, windows that allow natural heating) you can easily produce 100x the crops and fish that the footprint of a building would provide.

[–]DaveYarnell 2 points 13 days ago 
It could work in desert areas with abundant energy from solar and minimal access to water. Places like southern california.

[–]AtheistAustralis 3 points 14 days ago 
Not necessarily, it all depends on the crop. For many crops, the largest costs are picking, planting, ploughing, transport and packing. Having indoor farms reduces all of these costs significantly by virtue of vastly reduced travel distances, especially if robotic harvesting is employed - and robotic harvesting is much more efficient when performed indoors, as the layout is fixed, there is no weather (or mud) to contend with, and the crops are much more predictable in terms of where and how fast they will grow. The particular crop that I'm developing a harvesting system for requires considerably less energy when farmed indoors (greenhouse in order to take advantage of natural sunlight), not to mention an order of magnitude less water, fertiliser, pesticide, and space. Add to that the fact that you can grow year-round instead of only in one particular season, and the benefits are enormous. The most prohibitive barrier is the very high setup costs, especially for farmers who have already invested heavily in land, equipment and other infrastructure that will be made obsolete. Pollination is also an issue, as you need your own bee supply.

[–]togaman5000 1 point 14 days ago 
A lot of those would be tied to renewable resources, which could be folded into the primary benefit

[–]AtheistAustralis 3 points 14 days ago 
Oh yes, no doubt. Indoor growing uses more electricity, but less oil and other petrochemicals, so is much better suited to renewable energy systems. It's undoubtedly the way of the future, at least for some crops. Hard to imagine wheat, rice, corn, sugar, etc, being grown indoors in any meaningful quantity, but for vegetables, berries, and non-tree fruits it's inevitable. If only a small percentage of farm subsidies were redirected into research..

[–]togaman5000 1 point 14 days ago 
Looks like it'll be another unfortunate case of it not happening until economic viability is in the near future

[–]factoid_ 16 points 14 days ago 
Yeah and it also doesn't work for all kinds of foods. Great for lettuce, but you aren't going to grow mass amounts of all vegetables this way.

[–]ominous_anonymous 2 points 14 days ago 
Well, the benefit in that sense would be space-saving, right? All the lettuce fields get condensed, meaning you can grow other stuff in those fields instead.

[–]factoid_ 1 point 14 days ago 
Oh yeah I definitely don't mean to imply we shouldn't do this where we can. We absolutely should. Bringing crop production closed to the point of consumption is good, reducing water usage is good. If the electricity supply is clean this is a win win.

You don't want just any factory. There is a reason they built this in a semiconductor factory. They go to incredible lengths to keep unwanted microbes out of the factory farm. Semiconductor factories are very clean and probably already had excellent air handlers.
Purpose built facilities will probably be needed.
However keeping out all microbes is a mistake in my opinion. Especially if you are making significant amounts of the world's food in this way eventually. You don't want delicate food crops that can't handle a contagion. If one ever gets in it can wipe out a whole factory easily. Dealing with a little lower yield to retain resilience is a good tradeoff in my opinion

[–]CarlosWeiner 2 points 14 days ago 
Urban farmer here. You are right. But we are looking at a completely self sufficient system using solar

[–]ominous_anonymous 1 point 14 days ago 
How is that energy stored? Do you have batteries on-site? Do you push it back into "the grid?" What happens when you have extended time of insufficient conditions for converting solar energy?

[–]CarlosWeiner 2 points 14 days ago 
We're looking into a few ways, while also waiting for legislation here that will allow us to not feed back into the grid. Not my area of expertise, we grow a lot of shit and I just manage the mushrooms.
We're also located in Bermuda, so the conditions are very good year round.

Urban farmer here. You are right. But we are looking at a completely self sufficient system using solar

[–]demonspawn79 2 points 14 days ago 
I believe that was using HID lamps (metal-halide or high-pressure sodium), which do use a massive amount of energy. LEDs on the other hand use a fraction of the energy used by HIDs, and they are becoming cheaper and cheaper to manufacture. I think it will be cheaper to grow indoors than to grow outdoors very soon.

[–]morriscey 2 points 14 days ago 
The more time passes and the more fuel goes up, the more cost of scale make it worth while. The amount of energy consumed is minimal when you compare how much power hydroponics used to use when they used HPS and MH bulbs. The cost is further reduced as the LEDs put out less heat, so cooling is less of an issue.
Hydroponics are going to become more and more important. plants grow faster, and are better FOR you, and a Hydroponics system is far more sustainable than a farm, and leaves far less to chance. there is a HELL of a lot less pollution involved as well.

[–]ominous_anonymous 1 point 14 days ago 
Thank you. I really like the idea, I just wanted the normal skepticism to be introduced and addressed and didn't personally have the knowledge needed to do so.

[–]ten24 4 points 14 days ago 
It uses 1% of the water, but ∞% more electricity than conventionally grown lettuce.

[–]Rephaite 7 points 14 days ago 
Not infinitely more. Conventional lettuce may not use LEDs, but many kinds of farm equipment have electrical systems. Many of them also have their own generators, but that's still a fuel cost for electrical use.

[–]LegendLength 1 point 14 days ago 
I wish they published the watts needed per lettuce. It would let you work out the cost in solar panels.

[–]Uphoria 3 points 14 days ago 
I think though criticism has been using bad numbers. The direct cost to produce the lettuce is higher, but there is a much shorter Field->Food Market distribution chain, and the lower footprint means lowered real-estate costs.
This is a concept the Japanese want to perfect so they can grow more food on their own, and use more land for people. When there isn't any more land to grow onto, your priorities shift.

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 14 days ago 
It uses far more than 1% of the water. That number is made up.

[–]briaen 1 point 14 days ago 
That and there is more food now than we can sell. If the worlds population doubled, US farming companies would figure out how to meed demand.

[–]showyourdata 2 points 14 days ago 
They are have problems with water now, imagine if it's doubled.

[–]Xorondras 1 point 14 days ago 
Yes, the energy costs surpass the water savings and in regions where water is not a problem, it just increases the price for vegetables and fruits grown in such factories.

[–]WireRabbit 1 point 14 days ago 
With the recent increase in solar panel conversion, it's much more plausible. Just set solar panels on every roof in the city. Boom, huge solar panel farm lol. Use them to power crop lights.

[–]The_Write_Stuff 1 point 14 days ago 
Seems like that would depend on whether you're just powering the LEDs or if you also needed to heat the building. Many of the energy cost studies were done before highly efficient lighting options existed. LED lighting is pretty efficient but heating the building, yikes. That would be a budget buster. I suppose there's some waste heat out there somewhere but that's making the set up more complicated.

[–]CheesypoofExtreme 1 point 14 days ago 
Even if energy is a factor... Couldn't you do this primarily in places like California and Arizona with solar panels, (lots of sun year round), and still distribute the crops? We're close to self driving electric vehicles. In the 20 years it'll take to get one of these made in the US, (because everything takes forever here), we'll have the ability to produce self driving electric trucks and probably a fairly robust grid of charging stations at that point.

[–]Red_Inferno 1 point 14 days ago

[–]maxitobonito 66 points 14 days ago* 
Slightly different, but the Netherlands are one of the biggest producers of vegetables in Europe, and all of it from hydroponic farms.
That being said, the stuff that reaches our supermarkets in the Czech Rep. is totally devoid of anything resembling flavour, and I'm not sure about its nutritious value, but it's cheap.

[–]Snoman13 51 points 14 days ago 
I think this has more to do with the fact that when produce is shipped over long distances, it tends to be picked prematurely, and then exposed to a substance that triggers the ripening reaction just before it's put on sale. This ends up with the produce looking properly ripe, but lacking in flavour. We have the same issue here in Canada with our produce depending on what time of year you purchase/where its coming from.

[–]maxitobonito 19 points 14 days ago 
We're in agreement there.
I also read that the other day that putting tomatoes in the fridge somehow fucks up the chemical compounds that give them flavour. It made me wonder whether: a) that doesn't apply to other produce and b) whether those Dutch tomatoes aren't aren't shipped in refrigerated lorries.

[–]Deadmirth 21 points 14 days ago 
Another problem with tomatoes is that selecting for uniform color also coincidentally selects against flavor

[–]maxitobonito 13 points 14 days ago 
We grow tomatoes in our garden and we have never, ever been able to a whole vine(?) of tomatoes of the same size, and colour, as you will see in supermarkets. We pick them as they get ripe.

[–]Tahmatoes 12 points 14 days ago 
And once you taste them, you're ruined for life for other tomatoes. :<

[–]cveba 3 points 14 days ago 
Large scale tomato growers use determinate tomato varieties (that ripen at the same time all at once and can be machine harvested), and those varieties have been specially selected to give the uniform look vs taste etc. there are seed labs that often sell seeds at 1€ a piece for these special varieties, it's crazy. They are also often machine sorted into grades of size, color, quality looks etc. Some are even picked green, then kept refrigerated until the market price is better, then ripened using ethylene gas, which gives them a ripe color but leaves them completely tasteless...

[–]maxitobonito 1 point 14 days ago 
Thanks for that! It explains a lot.

[–]RespectTheTree 1 point 14 days ago 
It's a result of hydroponic production, it usually (always) ends up tasting like water.

[–]Snoman13 1 point 13 days ago 
Can you provide some proof of that please? I don't understand how water, which soil-grown plants use as well impact the taste that significantly. Underripe produce ends up tasteless and the process used by the industry to prolong shelf life by picking under ripe fruit and then artificially ripening it would intuitively be more reasonable to me.

[–]SIr_Jackinton 1 point 13 days ago 
I found this to be the case with my experience while in England. The tomatoes did not taste right. Like a watery bitter taste. As opposed to Australia, in which they taste sweet and juicy. I don't know exactly if it was the variety was different but they had been shipped from overseas.

[–]Gorgeous-Glen 2 points 14 days ago*

and all of it from hydroponic farms.
Huh? The Netherlands is 55% farmland.

[–]maxitobonito 5 points 14 days ago* 
But they use that farmland to grow tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and other produce year-round?

[–]doodle77 3 points 14 days ago 
No, but they don't only produce vegetables from hydroponic farms.

[–]maxitobonito 1 point 14 days ago 
Any idea how much of that produce comes from hydroponic and how much comes from "traditional" farming? I would also imagine they use much of that farmland to produce fodder or as grasslands.

[–]G7K 22 points 14 days ago 
Mass shipping is very cheap and low emitting in comparison to the energy costs and emissions for a setup like this.

[–]GodsFavAtheist 3 points 14 days ago

[–]alonjar 7 points 14 days ago 
Largest gross emission, yes.... but very efficient on a per kg/lbs basis.

The last 20 times this has been posted, the first thought that has come to mind is Detroit. I know they're trying to start an outdoor urban farm movement in the areas that have been abandoned, but obviously the climate isn't the best for that to be very effective. What they DO have though is an abundance of empty warehouses, and I've always thought how cool it would be to turn Detroit into a model of regrowth and prosperity by being one of the leaders of indoor agriculture. Especially given how the weather is becoming so unpredictable across the globe, which makes it that much harder to produce a sustainable crop.
Sometimes I wish I were a governor or congressman for a city that has been hit hard by the economy, or better yet just have the money of a Mark Cuban/Bill Gates, and fund these types of projects on my own.

Holy cow that's awesome! I had no idea they were trying this in the states already. I thought it was just outdoor urban farming. Thanks for the heads up.

[–]Dirk_Hardbody 22 points 14 days ago 
If it was profitable to do this, don't you think people would already be doing it?

[–]VHSRoot 7 points 14 days ago 
Yes and no. Of course people would be doing it already if it were more profitable than growing out in California. At the same time, its a method of agriculture that is only beginning to be fully researched and understood. If the industry comes up with better methods of growing, it could certainly become a reality.

[–]LegendLength 2 points 14 days ago

It's profitable in Japan, which is a net importer of food

[–]VHSRoot 16 points 14 days ago 
It might be profitable for some very seasonal products like strawberries or avocados. They could be grown year-round instead of being imported from South America during the offseason

Trees cannot be grown in indoor facilities. Apparently without wind they will not grow strong enough to support themselves.

[–]mfball 0 points 14 days ago 
People might also be willing to pay more for the opportunity to grow their own produce at home with this kind of tech. It's probably not nearly as cost effective when scaled down to a manageable size for the average home, but it would be cool to be able to grow your own produce during winter instead of buying lower-quality stuff that's been shipped thousands of miles.

[–]7point7 1 point 14 days ago 
Or have neighborhood co-ops like they do now, but based on hydroponics instead of just outdoor gardening.

How exactly is lettuce growing going to get bad or worse?

[–]newtonium 1 point 14 days ago 
The growing itself may not but the situations depending upon it surely can. How about limited arable land and exploding population? Or the extraordinary drought in California and the fact that farming consumes the majority of water in the state?

[–]IlllIIIIIIlllll 1 point 13 days ago 
But clearly in those situations whether the bad happens or not is uncertain. It would be pretty stupid to start growing really expensive lettuce based on the presumption that there will be limited arable land. 10 years later "Oh shit you know what? Turns out that in fact there is plenty of land around the world for growing lettuce. Shut it down"

[–]Blix- 2 points 14 days ago

[–]_Red_Rooster_ 1 point 14 days ago 
In most places the answer is a resounding NO. In places that have very limited agricultural land and very high import tariffs on food, such as Japan, it is viable. A quick little chart will illustrate why:
NEEDS Hydroponics Traditional Farm
land-------------low--------high
water-----------low--------mid-high
electricity-------high-------none*
equipment-------high-------low
Large scale hydroponics is only profitable when the the prices of land and/or water are very high.
*The growth of the plants themselves requires no electricty

[–]vatreehugger 1 point 14 days ago 
The problem is you're assuming that what makes it unprofitable is that the process itself must simply be inferior to conventional farming. Our agricultural subsidies have a huge influence in what's "profitable" and can really obstruct the implementation of new techniques and technologies.
So we need to look into this is actually a pretty important sentiment to spread around and send to our representatives to get processes like this due consideration when new policies are being effected. Saying it's as simple as "someone will do it once it's viable" is just unrealistic in our over-subsidized agricultural market.

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 14 days ago 
It is profitable, and many people are doing it :)

[–]AboveDisturbing 1 point 14 days ago 
I don't think profit should be a motivation, honestly. A break even scenario with some reserve operating costs should be the goal. No vital industry should be for profit (pharmaceuticals, healthcare, etc.)

No one is saying don't do it. They're saying it's dumb to tell other people to look into it because you yourself are 0% involved in the field.
Obviously someone did look into it, hence the farm in japan. It just as obviously isn't profitable because otherwise it would have caught on. This is not a new development.

[–]dissonance07 2 points 14 days ago 
Isn't transportation kind of low on the list of energy inputs to store bought produce? What of the heavy machinery and fertilizers used in heavy commercial farming?
Anyways, this also takes up a lot of space - something that is significantly cheaper on a farm than in a city.

[–]NotTheProgurt 0 points 13 days ago

I'd rank it between the machinery and the fertilizers in terms of ecological impact. Higher than machinery, but lower than fertilizer.

[–]5th_Law_of_Robotics 38 points 14 days ago 
Me too. I mean it cuts down on water and space which can be extremely valuable or pretty much worthless depending on where you're at.
Increase in power costs: no matter how efficient LEDs are they're going to cost more than sunlight.
Decrease costs associated with pesticide and damage due to pests.
And then I have no clue what it does for labor costs which in a developed nation can be pretty significant.

[–]I_am_not_angry 32 points 14 days ago 
The huge win in this design is that they lose less then 1% of the crop to damage bugs and disease. Most fields run 10-25 percent on average. But that was just enough to make it a break even proposal due to power and water costs....
Until they get these new LEDs and dropped power costs making the "Farm" profitable at regular crop selling price.

[–]XBebop 5 points 14 days ago 
Of course, they could invest in a solar farm, which could cut costs in the long-term.

[–]cheezstiksuppository 2 points 13 days ago 
Even longer term. Most LEDs are going to become solid state lasers eventually. The efficiency of lasers will go even bigger once we can make good waveguides out of them.

[–]stokleplinger 2 points 14 days ago 
What lettuce farms are operating on a 10-25% damage factor, and how long have they been bankrupt? Any produce farm would absolutely tank at those levels of wastage.

[–]I_am_not_angry 3 points 14 days ago 
From seed to market.... all of them.

[–]stokleplinger 0 points 14 days ago 
Absolute nonsense. I'd be amazed if you could find some ARS data that supports that level of waste from farm to market. That level of waste from market-consumer? I'd believe it, but from planting-harvest and from harvest-market there's no way there's that much waste in a produce crop, everyone involved would be losing their shirts.

[–]McEirhead 1 point 14 days ago 
Personally, I see the water part of it as an insignificant advantage. Rain water is your supply most of the time, and often irrigation systems use on farm water sources like lakes, rivers, collected surface water or underground water. The water that is "wasted" on an outdoor irrigation system simply re-enters ecosystem.
After that it becomes a business case. Ya the indoor system can produce more crop in less time on the same amount of space, but what's the overhead? What's the power consumption? In Japan it makes sense because land is at a premium... but what about in Canada where land is cheap and plentiful? Perhaps there is room for a hybrid of both systems so that cities could be provided locally during the Canadian winter... and sure, it probably could be more efficient than dealing with transportation and waste, but that's assuming you get the overhead costs down, which I assume hasn't been done yet, otherwise the system would likely already be gaining more steam than it is. It costs money and energy to build big buildings. Ever wonder how much CO2 emissions there are from laying the concrete base of a factory? It's a lot.

[–]Humorlessness 1 point 13 days ago 
This type of farm is probably not a farm for every country. Some countries have cheap land, and many diffferent water sources?
But the population is always increasing. There will be more and more land use in the coming decades as cities sprawl outwards. Also, water use will become more important in the near future as climate change makes it more difficult to make sure everyone has enough water.
So, what I'm saying is that essentially, if these types of farms are not profitable now, then in the future, they will be more profitable, and useful.

[–]DAVIDcorn 1 point 14 days ago 
Yeah the thing is if they save enough they can put in solar panels one at a time till they have enough to power the whole place, and then their power costs would be basically nothing. After some time they would make back their investment and be way more profitable.

[–]tatsukunwork 1 point 14 days ago 
But don't forget that they have a lot more density of plant material, so less land. In anything in Japan, land is probably the top cost.

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 14 days ago

[–]gnawledger 5 points 14 days ago* 
Food in Japan isn't exactly cheap.
Edit : raw vegetables such as potatoes and onions are usually bought on a per piece basis as against the norm in most places of weight based prices. Organically grown or such lettuces command a further premium price per piece.

[–]tomdarch 1 point 14 days ago 
And there is a market for very expensive, "perfect" food items, so in that context, this might make sense.
In just about any other situation, no. It's absurdly more expensive than normal farming.

[–]Yurei21 1 point 14 days ago 
False: A decent sammich costs 5000 yen, this is about the same as 5 USD. The Yen only has one unit, the Yen, while most currencies have many units (pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, half-dollars, dollar coin, dollar bill...) so their prices seem higher, but not especially so. It's just like if you said the price of any product in pennies.

They should attach these farms to gyms, and then generate electricity from the people peddling bikes, ellipticals, etc...

[–]jjbpenguin 4 points 14 days ago 
There are a few gyms that use this gimmick to say their members power the gym, but people are terrible generators. Your typical gym member on an elliptical or stationary bike can maintain about 100 watts of power through their workout. Over the course of an hour, that comes out to 1 cent. A gym could barely keep their own lights on with the energy people generate.

[–]curiousdude 3 points 14 days ago 
Exactly! Many people come up with this idea, but they never do the math to find out how ridiculously impractical it is. It's not even close. It's so far from being practical it's laughable, like a child thinking he can get to the moon with a high enough stack of pillows.

[–]AwfulBigBrother 2 points 14 days ago 
It does but if you look at the long term issues involved like the need for fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, crop yields that correlate with increasingly unpredictable weather, topsoil erosion, runoff and the effect on ocean ecosystems/the livelihoods that depend on them, etc. The cost is much less than it first seems.
It still may not break even financially for quite some time but taking the whole agriculture picture as a whole it's getting there.

[–]Dr_Hibbert_Voice 0 points 14 days ago 
While true, here in the states there's a lot of disused industrial space just waiting for a tenant. Finding an existing building would be easy.

[–]ten24 2 points 14 days ago 
There's also a lot of empty space without any buildings. And most of them have lighting and shelving preinstalled

Too bad you get almost nothing out of fields. Indoor farming simply blows away outdoor farming, no contest, it's like a T-1000 vs a puppy.

[–]Bluedrink 1 point 13 days ago 
I think the part we are all missing here is the 1% of the amount of water. Take this into consideration along with the larger yield, crops not being lost to pests (or even needing to spray pesticides), soil regeneration, property taxes, and farming equipment. It's only a matter of time before all of our crops are mass produced indoors.

[–]111691 0 points 14 days ago 
Farm equipment and storage buildings are not...

[–]AeroSpiked 0 points 14 days ago 
Free when available. I'm sure there are a lot of people who would like fresh produce in the upper and lower latitudes where sun is scarce for 6 months of the year. Nor are the outdoor growing conditions suitable during those times. Produce that has been shipped 3000 miles could rarely be considered fresh and the shipping expense is also considerable.

[–]vi0cs 0 points 14 days ago 
Sunlight isn't always guaranteed nor is the use of the land due to mother nature.

No worries! The government can just subsidize it!
/s/

[–]coryeyey 1 point 14 days ago 
It would have to be subsidized but in certain cases that would be worth it. Like California for example. They have a huge water crisis and a space crisis and also have a good amount of money to throw around. So it might be viable for at least that one state.

[–]bink_uk 9 points 14 days ago 
It uses less water but it does use electricity unlike a conventional, outdoor farm. Is that where these kinds of systems fall down, efficiency-wise?

[–]mfball 5 points 14 days ago 
Electricity is more expensive than using the sun for free, of course, but given that they can grow faster and suffer way less crop loss, the process can only get more efficient as LEDs get cheaper. They could probably also use solar to power the lights, defraying cost further.

[–]Spitinthacoola 1 point 14 days ago 
It just depends on what efficiency you need to optimize for.

from the last time this was posted:
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3j92l2/a_japanese_vertical_farming_company_has_begun/cunxazm
Late to the party, but I have very in depth knowledge on this subject. I have a huge hydroponic facility being constructed right now.
I see a lot of things being said so let me clear up what I can.
Water usage:
In our lab, we currently have this down to 3% of traditional farming for each pound of bio mass produced. It is conceivable to have it down to 1% but I have yet to see a system in person that is designed well enough to accomplish this.
Economics:
This is a bit more complicated. There are a few facets to this. Recently, a trend for local sourcing of food has been picking up and just as with organic food, people are willing to pay a premium for local food. Furthermore, many of the largest grocery chains actually pay for shipment of the greens either as part of an FOB delivery system (in which the grocery companies pick up the product with their own trucks) or by having the cost of shipping added on to the cost of goods (sometimes as a separate invoice). Most hydroponic plants actually are a bit more expensive to produce than traditional farming in America, but their shorter shipping path and farm to market time offsets that expense due to a combination of lower shipping costs and accepted premiums for local and longer-lasting produce. One other thing of note is that there aren't the subsidies in place that traditional farming can take advantage of, so hydro farms really have to be on point on what they produce, how much they produce, and how often.
Seasonality:
Being grown indoors allows for the hydroponic farm to produce anything all year round as temperature, humidity, and light variation can be strictly controlled. There are still variations, but most of these come down to design flaws.
Utilities:
This is a mixed bag. There are certainly ways in which use of artificial light can be removed and cost of cooling can be lessened, but it is often a trade-off for environmental stability and quality of final product. There are several types of lights from fluorescent and MH (metal-halide) for vegetative-only plants to HPS (high pressure sodium) for flowering and fruiting plants (and their wavelenght-tuned LED counterparts). The problem is that MH and HPS are power hungry and LEDs are capital hungry. So there are trade-offs everywhere and a facility has to do some strongly supported number crunching to figure out what is operationally most viable.
Crop:
This is the most important thing. While being true that you can grow anything hydroponically with the right system, you have to have a reason to grow it. DIY systems are fun for personal use but fail if you really don't need what you're growing because people tire of the upkeep. It's isn't that much work, but there is a learning curve and there are some tedious activities involved. On a larger scale, most hydroponic farms fail because they don't do their research. Why do you think every hydro farm on this scale is always cited as growing X heads of lettuce per day? Because lettuce (and other salad filler) is easy and cheap to grow. The problem usually ends up being that you've grown too much lettuce and now have nowhere to sell it. Remember, for the VAAAAST majority of hydroponic farms, the final numbers they have to meet are higher than traditional farms, so these places can't afford to dump their product at low prices.
I'm sure I'm leaving out a lot, but I'm losing cohesion in this ramble. But feel free to ask questions and I'll try to answer what I can. Hopefully I can do an AMA once we are up and running and I don't have to avoid details as I do now.

[–]Sebas94 2 points 14 days ago 
Thank you! at last someone that i can talk to that knows this stuff from the inside :) Do you think that indoor LED vertical farming will be the future? Do you think that one day people will start to buy this and start learning the basics, like plating lettuce and carrots?

To be fair, every time it's posted I find another way in which it isn't feasible. It would be sick if the world could live off iceberg lettuce though.

[–]Rancel21342 1 point 14 days ago 
I mean it is feasible. With potatoes at least. They are one of the only foods that you COULD live off almost exclusively. Albeit you'll probably get scurvy and some other nasties, but you could live for a long time. Potatoes are a super food. I can't imagine how much lettuce you would have to eat just to feel full though lol. At least you'd be hydrated while you died

[–]Kulhu 2 points 14 days ago 
You won't get scurvy from potato

[–]Rancel21342 1 point 13 days ago 
Good to know. I didn't realize they contained vitamin C. In the skin I imagine?

[–]mytest135 1 point 13 days ago 
I asked google, and potatoes have 19.7 milligrams of vitamin c per 100 grams of potatoe. I assume that means it's not in the skin.

[–]Loves_His_Bong 1 point 14 days ago 
My buddy calls it crunchy water.

[–]Sapian 1 point 13 days ago 
This is the early stages of experiments, lettuce was only used because it's an easy first test subject, if it can grow lettuce well then other crops will be tested eventually too.
Places where space is at a premium like Japan will need stuff like this more and more in the future. And it has several advantages I see. Water useage, bug and disease control, automated harvesting, space saving, localized growing, tight control of minerals and materials used, rapid plant growth, potential for being solar powered. Not sure if I missed any other advantages..
And I'm wondering if they only need certain UV spectrums can filtered glass be used during the day and only use the LED's at night?

[–]TheBigBadPanda 26 points 14 days ago 
How does it affect nutrition and flavor? The result in this kind of production is usually really watery and low quality, much like the difference between oak and fir. Oak grows slower, but the wood is much more dense and hardy.

[–]PMunch 18 points 14 days ago 
As the other guy said your tree analogy might not be accurate. But it's still a good question. Minerals and vitamins in produce doesn't just appear out of thin air, so the soil still has to contain these things for this to get nutrition. He mentioned something about reducing the thickness of the growing medium so I'm a bit skeptical that this would be as good as "traditional" farming. And even if this factory is, what stops the competing factory down the street to remove some of the expensive nutrition from the soil?

[–]TheBigBadPanda 6 points 14 days ago 
Right. I would really like to see some in depth analysis on this, could be important as hydroponics will likely become more common.
As it is i only have anecdotal experience, but the difference between a factory grown head of iceberg lettuce from the netherlands and one that is locally farmgrown is big enough to consider them different produce when it comes to cooking. Im curious if it extends beyond flavor though.

[–]MIKE6792 -2 points 14 days ago 
Socialism

[–]spekreep 5 points 14 days ago* 
Most modern greenhouses use hydroponic systems. Big chance you are already accustomed to the taste of hydroponic tomato and lettuce if you live in a heavily urbanised area. The sole difference here is that they use 0 sunlight, but light doesn't influence the taste.
In terms of nutrition, there isn't much of a difference really with store bought tomatoes or lettuce, the compositions are basically identical.
Growing vegetables in your backyard is different though.

[–]chozoart 4 points 14 days ago 
Yes flavor is affected and will not taste the same as soil-grown lettuce. Although there are some techniques that can be applied to enhance flavor such as tweaking the pH levels of the medium and adding magnesium sulfates.

[–]CombativeAccount 2 points 14 days ago 
Perhaps, if the flavor isn't up to par, we could start off by shifting feed production to vertical farming. A seemingly tenable solution that gives time to perfect the technique while making use of the product.

[–]Spitinthacoola 2 points 14 days ago 
Not really though. With high quality nutrients you're going to get stuff that is better than soil. Especially as soil quality has decreased drastically and our food is getting less nutritious from outdoor farming.

[–]factoid_ 1 point 14 days ago 
I haven't eaten this particular lettuce from this facility but I have had hydroponic lettuce. In general it is the same as what's grown in the ground. The leaves are actually somewhat thicker because they are able to grow without competition, disease, pests etc. Every head of lettuce is healthy and perfect.
Hydroponic tomatoes can also be just as good as regular tomatoes but most places are growing lame varieties and picking them early to extend shelf life.

[–]VeritablyClean -1 points 14 days ago

[–]UmbrellaCorp1961 -3 points 14 days ago

Article is somewhat misleading, 10k heads of lettuce is great but show me production numbers for foods with actual nutritional content, lettuce is pretty much worthless in terms of providing sustenance.

Those guys are really close together, you will probably want to spread them out a bit if possible when they start fruiting. It's not a make or break type of thing, but your plants will be happier with some elbow room.
Looks like Hydroton in the buckets, whats going in there?

[–]pwnguin909 1 point 13 days ago

What is hydroton? I'm using fox farm.

[–]Environ_MENTAL_ist 1 point 13 days ago 
hydroton is a brand of clay pellets, typically used in hydroponics, so I was curious as to what's in your buckets since you aren't doing hydro.
Fox farm is the shit, I think your setup looks good, you got a fan, what looks like a humidifier, if you spread the plants out you'll probably need to get more lights, and those LED rigs look expensive, so I'd just keep rolling with what you got unless you absolutely have to change it up. Honestly, I'm a little jelly of your massive grows, those plants look good.

[–]pwnguin909 1 point 13 days ago 
I've been having issues bringing my plants to fruit inside. Tbh my lights were dirt cheap :)

Looks like a great setup. I would research any effects the uvb spectrum have on your pepper output. It's rarely addressed for my plants but makes a huge difference.
Uvb is the same spectrum people use for blue light therapy, and killing bacteria.

[–]NoFucksGiver 0 points 14 days ago 
how about the nutritional value? can it compare with traditional farming? i am pretty sure plants cant get their vitamins from thin air.

[–]Environ_MENTAL_ist 1 point 14 days ago 
They get them from the nutrients/media in the bucket.
For a real over simplification of your question: Higher quality light=more photosynthesis=more starchy delicious sugars. This doesn't always translate directly to nutritional content (there are a lot of factors involved with this that I don't want to get into) but having available energy stores allows plants to synthesize the complex chemicals that we call vitamins and so much more.
It does compare to "traditional" farming. (I put traditional in quotes because it's a terrible way to describe modern agricultural practices)

[–]pwnguin909 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm pretty sure plants get their nutrients from the potting medium, and the supplementary ferts.

Didn't say 'marijuana' I said 'weed'.
Since it's been called weed, and thus the recreational 'experience' we know of today, hydroponics has been a common method of cultivation.
But yes, you are correct and I am wrong.

[–]81_BLUNTS_A_DAY 1 point 13 days ago 
Marijuana (also known as weed) has been used for recreation since long before we used the term weed. The experience doesn't differ when you call it something different.
In fact, the term 'weed' is used to mean an unwanted plant, and when marijuana use was outlawed it took on the term.

[–]OmenLW 7 points 14 days ago 
Hydroponics is more about the medium the plant is grown in and not the lighting.

[–]KaptainKannabis 1 point 14 days ago 
Good lighting is just as important as a good balance of nutrients in a hydroponic grow. If the lights are too close the plant gets way too hot and stressed, if the lights are too far away by just a few inches you will notice a reduced yield.

You'd be surprised how many people use $2 cfl bulbs you can buy from amazon(albeit a couple of them) and still yield about 0.8 to 1 gram per watt, especially with new techniques coming out like Fluxing which i mentioned above. I wasn't part of the early 2000 grows, but I can tell you the current things coming out of the growing communities now are pretty good, don't dismiss em :)

[–]UncleGrga 0 points 14 days ago 
can show you me a grow thread where somebody is getting 1 gram per watt with a cfl?
I work on the commercial end of the industry and used to grow commercially underground for around 15 years. If somebody is honestly getting 1 gram per watt with a CFL they could become a millionaire pretty quickly.
These days the cutting edge of larger scale growing is double ended HPS, imo florescent bulbs really only have their place on clone racks and in the grow-tents of rollitup.org members.

It works, but IMO it doesn't work well. I've been a master grower in CO for nearly six years and I"ve seen a lot of grows. I've seen one grow that relies on LEDs for flowering, and I've heard of some guys using them for veg growth, but they just don't compete with HID bulbs for flowers.
Eventually LEDs will probably come down enough in price and be altered in a way that will make them work for flowering but I think that is still years away.
I also don't believe they were developed for weed, as these things have been in development for decades. From Wikipedia:
The first LEDs were developed in the early 1960s, however, they were low-powered and only produced light in the low, red frequencies of the spectrum. The first high-brightness blue LED was demonstrated by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation in 1994.[43] The existence of blue LEDs and high-efficiency LEDs quickly led to the development of the first white LED, which employed a phosphor coating to mix down-converted yellow light with blue to produce light that appears white.[44] Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Nakamura were later awarded the 2014 Nobel prize in physics for the invention of the blue LED.[45]
The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 authorized the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish the Bright Tomorrow Lighting Prize competition, known as the "L Prize", the first government-sponsored technology competition designed to challenge industry to develop replacements for 60 W incandescent lamps and PAR 38 halogen lamps. The EISA legislation established basic requirements and prize amounts for each of the two competition categories, and authorized up to $20 million in cash prizes.[46] The competition also included the possibility for winners to obtain federal purchasing agreements, utility programs, and other incentives. In May 2008, they announced details of the competition and technical requirements for each category. Lighting products meeting the competition requirements could use just 17% of the energy used by most incandescent lamps in use today. That same year the DOE also launched the Energy Star program for solid-state lighting products. The EISA legislation also authorized an additional L Prize program for developing a new “21st Century Lamp”.

[–]thalguy 2 points 14 days ago 
Yes, it works. Many people say these LEDs don't give off any heat. That isn't the case though, especially for the LEDs designed to replace 1k lights. So you still need to control your heat.

[–]40kkm 1 point 14 days ago 
This type of vertical system doesn't work for weed, unless you force flower at a really young stage. These racks are 12-15" high, so cannabis doesn't really fit in there. These particular systems are for leafy greens or microgreens generally. Hydroponics works for it though.

[–]rolledupdollabill 1 point 14 days ago 
you could always go the bonzai plant route, with some of the lower powered leds you can have the lights touching your plants.
you can also use a low ceiling for veg or early bloom...using a high blue light spectrum your plants don't get very tall

I'd be interested to know, factoring in the energy cost to build the building and maintain all of the materials, if it's actually more efficient than a field. I wonder how long you'd have to wait for the energy cost of construction to be compensated for by the increased efficiency.
Also, what about nutrients and soil? Is producing fertilizer, in the end, more efficient than fields? How long does it take for it to be more efficient or for the initial higher energy suck to pay for itself?

[–]Umbrifer 1 point 14 days ago 
You still have to fertilize or rotate crops to keep agricultural fields viable and able to grow crops for more than 2 or 3 seasons or the soil becomes exhausted and you wont grow anything

[–]freeandbroke 1 point 12 days ago 
It's true. I'd like to see a complete comparison of energy expenditure for the building and traditional crops -- from start to finish. I'm guessing that it would take a long time for the building to "pay for itself" in energy gains, whereas crops might be less energy intensive in the short term.

[–]FlyingTexican 4 points 14 days ago 
Maybe I'm out of line, but I feel like most people on reddit don't understand the sheer scale of agriculture. I'm trying to imagine requisitioning buildings in a major city to replace even a single major farm and I just can't see that happening. Could it be done on the outskirts in warehouses and the like? Yeah, probably, but if you're gonna have to truck the goods into the city anyway why not just grow the stuff in a field?
(Purposely avoiding the energy argument cause it's already been posted a bajillion times)

[–]boom_wildcat 1 point 13 days ago 
But imagine if you could implement this into a farm!
You could stack your crops and essentially have more land and if it is in large building then you could avoid seasons, weather, bugs, disease, etc. I know the energy required is a big factor but with optimaztion and research this could be a very viable answer for the future.

[–]NikiHerl 10 points 14 days ago 
Hehe.
The LEDs also last longer than fluorescent lights and consume 40 percent less power.
You know what consumes even less power? Not producing and using those 17500 LEDs and letting the sun do the work instead. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea and the fact that we already have working examples of it, but we can't just ignore that indoor farming always comes with a trade-off.

[–]ben7337 6 points 14 days ago 
Its in Japan. Japan is 70% mountains and the bulk of the rest is people. They have hardly any space to farming land. If this was just a sun powered greenhouse, the lettuce would grow much slower and you could only have one layer of lettuce because lower layers would get no light. This place grows the lettuce faster and has many rows of lettuce stacked vertically, thus being far more spatially efficient, and producing far more than would be viable under traditional methods. It may not be the most ideal for countries like the US, but in Japan, its sort of revolutionary and should help with the cost of produce down the line.

[–]Antares_Delta 4 points 14 days ago 
Because energy is cheap, space is not a premium in Japan, and they've lost a hundred mile radius around Fukushima to radiation. That's a massive amount of arable land lost.
Further, in case you forgot, the sun sets in the West everyday. Let me know when you can guarantee the sun 24/7, and then we'll talk.

I have had tomatoes grown from one of those farms and they have no flavor and are just disappointing.

[–]Procks1061 24 points 14 days ago* 
These days that is the same for most commercial tomatoes no matter thr farm. They're picked early before the tomatoe ripens so they can be transported easily. You get the highest concentration of lycopene when it ripens on the vine.
Want good tasting tomatoes either grow them yourself or pick them up from a farmers market.
Edit 1: Lycopene is what makes it red and can develop off the vine, sorry I forgot the key flavour compounds, I'll check in the morning)
Edit 2: Key flavours include cis-3-hexenal, hexanal, cis-3-hexenol, β-ionone, β-damascenone, 1-penten-3- one, 3-methylbutanal, 2-isobuthylthiazole and sugar.

[–]DaSaw 2 points 14 days ago 
I won't buy anything but local or certified organic tomatoes for this very reason. I can taste the difference (and conventional store tomatoes are the reason that, for many years, I thought I didn't like tomatoes, because they're fucking nasty), and I think this is one of those things for which anyone can taste the difference.

[–]Procks1061 1 point 13 days ago 
You're preaching to the wrong guy about organic farming.
Sustainable farming practices are important, making sure that it's safe for the environment while minimising water, energy and fertuliser requirements. The sad truth about organic farming is that it's not going to feed the world.
I have the same opinion about GMOs, it's not GMOs that are unsafe it's the corporate greed and agressive legal practices. We've been genetically modifying crops for centuries through selective breeding to get produce that is more productive, pest/disease resistant and to have organoleptic properties. Splicing genes just speeds up the process.
So far I have grown tomatoes in ground both organic and fertilised and media in both aquaponic and hydroponic systems. Of those the best fruit I tasted were from the hydroponic and in ground non-organic plants. Why, they both had the most bioavailable nutrients to which allowed them to covert them to flavour compounds as they ripened.

[–]DaSaw 1 point 13 days ago 
Well, there's a reason I said "local or organic'. Right now, the only way to get tasty tomatoes in anything like a convenient fashion is to buy the organic stuff. Conventionally grown, field ripened stuff would be fine too, but for some reason only the organic stuff has a taste that says "field ripened" to me. Also, this applies primarily to tomatoes.
What we really need is less centralized vegetable growing... and hydroponics may well be part of that. Let places like California turn their water back over to the salmon and the marshes and such (and let them enjoy fresh local fish and waterfowl and such as a result), and let the rest of the country grow their own fruits and vegetables, so they can leave them in the field longer and end up with a better product.

I'm trying to say that when you mass produce them like that you deny them individual attention and love. You need to coddle and kiss them as they grow to give them the tender juicy flavor of a good ripe tomato. Mmm mmm good.
Also I imagine that some aspect of the mass produced process is causing them to suck.

Any link to an article commenting on how the TCO compares to a traditional field? Sure it takes the place of an outdoor area about 5x as large (2.5x growth rate plus 80% higher yield) but the building wasn't free and neither is the energy. Its super cool but at this point we arent actually that pressed for space, like we are pressed for energy and building materials.

Increased energy usage, artificial lighting, and water pumps. Increased efficiency in terms of usage of space and yield Crazy initial costs to set up infrastructure

[–]Samizdat_Press 1 point 14 days ago 
They are hydroponic all grown. The water stays in the system and they just supplement it with nutrients at certain intervals. Significantly less waste than soil growing. Leds make the energy costs affordable.
The downside to that is its basically only lettuce that can be economically grown this way, as LEDs aren't great for flowering plants, only leafy greens.
Check our /r/hydro for people who make these at game.

[–]jalif 2 points 14 days ago 
Sorry to break it to you, but the lettuce you buy is almost certainly grown hydroponically.
This is just an improved method.

[–]NotObviouslyARobot 2 points 14 days ago 
This is less than revolutionary. Lettuce isn't real food, and is generally calorie and nutrient poor. On the other hand lettuce is really expensive for what it is, so seeking huge cost savings and volume in lettuce farming makes sense as long as you don't produce enough to drive down the price.

You still have to use electricity to run the lights for this place rather than just energy from the sun which is about as free as it gets. Interesting idea but I would like to see the cost comparison of what it makes up for in better crop yield compared to what the cost of the electricity is to run it.

[–]RMJ1984 1 point 14 days ago 
Energy is easier to come by. Farming in fields are not only inefficient, and consumes space that would be used for nature. But its ruins the ground.

[–]tcoop6231 2 points 14 days ago 
Energy is also extremely expensive.
Water, land and chemicals are cheap compared to replacing the sun.
California is already draining the electric grid trying to grow a mere 30% of our marijuana crop indoors.
If they tried to move it all indoors, we'd have brownouts.

[–]hellounclefred 2 points 14 days ago 
Why don't they do the same thing for poultry? Just find the wavelength of the chicks, and adjust the lighting accordingly. I believe this will be the future in farming. It is a brilliant way to avoid the use of GMO, too.

[–]Yurei21 2 points 14 days ago

I think they're just looking to differentiate the two as a concept. Farming, even hydroponic farming in greenhouses is a few steps away from this type of food production. Every input and output is measured in places like this and statistical/business practices are applied in greater measure than traditional farming to enhance production levels or influence quality.
It's still a farm but leans more towards factory than it does traditional farming.

Relevant info from article:
A former Sony Corporation semiconductor factory in Japan has been converted into the world’s largest indoor farm. Japanese plant physiologist Shigeharu Shimamura, CEO of Mirai Co., partnered with GE Japan to make his dream of a water, space and energy efficient indoor farming system a reality. Despite having only started production a year ago, the farm is already shipping out 10,000 heads of lettuce per day.
The farm is located in Miyagi Prefecture in eastern Japan, the area that was badly hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011. At 25,000 square feet, it is nearly half the size of a football field, and 17,500 LED lights spread over 18 cultivation racks reaching 15 levels high are a key to the farm’s success. The LEDs were developed for the project by GE.
Of the successful partnership, Shimamura adds, “I knew how to grow good vegetables biologically and I wanted to integrate that knowledge with hardware to make things happen.” The GE Japan team is convinced that indoor farms like the one in the Miyagi Prefecture could be a key to solving world food shortages. The project partners are already working on similar indoor farms in Hong Kong and the Far East of Russia.

And how much power does the facility use?
Indoor plant growing doesn't make sense unless energy prices drop 10x or global land prices shoot up.

[–]spunfunk 1 point 14 days ago 
I run 75 large LED panels at my farm. We harvest $20,000 worth of crop a month and pay $1,000 in electricity/month. I wouldn't want to see a power bill of we ran all HPS lights. But were also not growing lettuce haha.

[–]londons_explorer 1 point 14 days ago 
Certain "crops" might work out, yes...

[–]spunfunk 1 point 13 days ago 
Most actually. In many climates indoor is the only way to produce food year round. Those energy bills sure beat importing food from far away.

[–]tddp 1 point 14 days ago 
It also depends how much energy is needed to harvest a field and then truck the produce all the way to the destination. This facility could potentially be put in the basement of an inner city supermarket, or even your home. The potential for transportation savings is phenomenal.

[–]hempfu 2 points 14 days ago 
I've seen this posted on TIL a few times now. But I've never seen anyone ever talks about how much energy more energy is needed to grow lettuce this while as opposed to conventional farming. I'm not against this kind of technology at all. I think it's very exciting. I'm just curious about how it comes to conventional farming in other ways.

[–]Lyianx 1 point 14 days ago 
Im not sure myself. But i do know, if it is maintainable energy from renewable sources (solar/wind ect..), it would be far more efficient and sustainable. Which when thinking about space missions (mars ect) is very important. Thats why i think its pretty cool :)

[–]hempfu 1 point 14 days ago 
That's a good point. If it could be powered off renewables, that would be amazing. Imagine one of these buildings covered in solar panels and generating enough power to grow tons more food!

Does Japan actually have such a water shortage that it must use all that energy to make this possible? Aren't you just trading water conservation for energy use?

[–]alkizmo 1 point 14 days ago 
Considering Nagano has snow banks that are over 10 feet tall and they waste energy to MELT the snow away... no, they don't have a water shortgage.
However, if that factory can a lot of floor space, then there is indeed an advantage to such factory.

[–]SamuelColeridgeValet 1 point 14 days ago 
Good question. It would be inconceivable with incandescent lamps, but consider the great efficiency of LED. A very bright LED flashlight seems to work forever without changing batteries. Also, it's not clear at this time how much energy will be available. Fusion is still an interesting idea. Some people are saying that the future of fusion reactors will depend on the demand for desalinization plants.

[–]Forestman88 1 point 14 days ago 
As others have stated....
If only there were a really bright light source just sitting up there in the sky that is available all day long but goes away at night.
Most places without enough water ALSO have lots of sunlight. It might make sense to use solar power to generate the power and then grow the plants in buildings near where the people live. You generate power in the day, just when the plants need it but don't generate the power at night...when the plants don't need it.
This just seems like more of an efficiency thing rather than a water conservation thing. Water is plentiful...just not where it is most needed.

[–]SamuelColeridgeValet 0 points 14 days ago*

Yes, it might. Fusion reaction is unproven. I thought I had made that clear.

[–]fjortisar 2 points 14 days ago 
The lettuce in the photo has fluorescent lights above them, so that's probably why. Maybe those are only turned on during specific hours or something.
I found another photo that looks like it just has the pink lights (not sure if it's from the same place though) http://jto.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/n-vegefactory-b-20140825.jpg

Incredible repost success but here me out, this works great in certain places. Think about the California drought, that level of water saving could be used to great effect in preventing overuse of water resources by Californian agriculture. In the end they are trying to grow food in a desert. So that is a great option to save water. Pacific Northwest? Not a good place, plenty of water but energy costs are gonna be the limiting factor.

This is cool because we could grow lettuce in these towers with solar panels, but there is definitely and energy tradeoff.

But hey, could always grow it underground with nuclear power! Until we have to change we'll be growing most stuff on the surface where there's no energy conversion other than sunlight to the plant

[–]TonyzTone 1 point 14 days ago 
Indoor farming is absolutely the way of the future. If some would take Elon Musk's ambition for Mars or fast rail travel into the development of systems of indoor farming, we can easily make this profitable within 10 years.
Most of the technology (solar, aquaponics, nutrient science, efficient lighting) is already here and it's about getting the pieces working together properly and upgrading the existing technologies to be even better.

[–]Umbrifer 1 point 14 days ago 
This is how a lot of indoor marijuana is already grown. And considering the use of hydroponics + aeroponics to increase yield, which are arguably more advanced growing techniques then using soil mediums, this is already profitable and sophistcated my friend. The war on drugs just needs to stop so all the techniques people have come up with can be disseminated freely and used in more varied applications.

[–]TonyzTone 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm well aware of marijuana being grown indoor using these techniques. I was talking about profitability within the realm of food crops not luxury crops. Legalization of marijuana will not necessarily translate into development of good techniques for food crops. While I support regulated legalization, I don't think it's a fix-all.

[–]Umbrifer 1 point 13 days ago 
I get you. And I'm not saying that legalization would be a fix all. Only that less people would be surprised and curious about this technique if its use wasn't forced underground. Maybe the questions popping up in this thread would have been answered by now if the real originators of this technique could have published their findings decades ago without fear of incarceration.
To address your concerns about "Luxury Crops" vs "Food Crops". I think you're making an arbitrary distinction that doesn't need to exist. A system that produces a healthy, well grown marijuana plant will produce a healthy, well grown spinach plant with a few adjustments to other ambient conditions and nutrient level. The benefit of these particular techniques is that they virtually remove photosynthesis as a limiting factor in plant growth. Because the photosynthetic mechanism is pretty much the same whether the plant is a "Food Crop" or a "Luxury Crop", there's no reason to think similar effects would not be seen if the crop was changed.
What I'm trying to say is that without the stigma we'd probably have more data to go on by now than lettuce and ganja. Underground growers have been using this technique to increase yields and this article pretty much confirms that the benefits are transferable to other kinds of crops.

[–]TonyzTone 1 point 13 days ago 
I don't think the distinction is that arbitrary since marijuana is a ridiculously durable plant resistant to many things. It's a weed and as any traditional growers know, weeds are harder to get rid of than to grow. Further, the distinction is even more pronounced in the fact that 1) luxury crops will fetch higher profit margins and 2) the ease at which you increase yields for luxury crops by using "-ponic" techniques cannot be easily replicated to other food crops.
Rice for example is an incredibly difficult thing to grow. Creating a hydroponic rice farm would require much different designs than a marijuana setup would if you were aiming for maximum profitability.
There might be a stigma but you can legally purchase hydroponic systems or create your own very easily to grow your own tomatoes.

[–]Umbrifer 1 point 13 days ago 
Ah, I misunderstood what you meant by Luxury Crop vs Food Crop. I thought you were referring to flowers or other ornamental plants. To address your other point I don't see why hydroponic techniques cannot be replicated to other food crops. especially when you consider that less of your crop will be discarded due to pests, contamination, etc. This study in question actually lists those factors as some of the reasons yields increased. Even if biomass produced per plant is identical to those grown in soil, the above benefits of a hydroponic system would mean greater yields anyway.
Also, I think that you've misunderstood me greatly. I'm explaining that the "new" technique here that growers have been using for decades and should be more widely used for other crops is the use of specific red and blue wavelengths instead of full spectrum lights. Whether the plants in question are grown hydroponically, aeroponically, or in soil mediums is a secondary concern. I personally think that Aeroponics would be the best method. Hydroponics being second, Soil mediums being third. But properly fertilized soil and properly fertilized hydroponic solution will both give healthy, profitable, and nutritious plants.

[–]TonyzTone 1 point 13 days ago 
I think we're mostly on the same page but a bit disjointed in message.
My main point is that we currently have most of the technologies needed to make indoor farming viable. The crop being grown is less important though it is a key factor. It's key because of market prices per unit vs. per price and the costs associated with increasing those yields. Certain crops can easily fetch higher prices and withstand broader growing techniques that allow for indoor farming much more easily.
The use of different wavelengths to optimize growing schedules and potential is well known. This is the hard part to implement. The hard part is to design an comprehensive system that allows for indoor, urban faming to be economically feasible.
You have to take into account the marginal cost of the entire production such as real estate, lighting, water, nutrients, and temperature control to just name a few. Each plant will require a specific set up in order to make it profitable.
The difference between choosing a hydroponic, aquaponic, aeroponic, or even an indoor soil system, requires careful calculations and monitoring to determine which would be the most suitable for each crop.
I personally think that aquaponics would be the most feasible because it creates the possibility to also produce profitable fish (which allows firms to withstand commodity fluctuations) and I believe would have potential to reduce energy costs through the set-ups water system.

Indoor farms are a good idea. Nuclear winter as a result of a meteor or Yellowstone blowing its top (I am assuming that nuclear war would result in the destruction of these farms, unless they were deepish underground. Some would probably survive a natural disaster though.) The main problem of the temp dropping a few degrees is a lot of crops dying, so take the outdoor temp out of the equation.

The economics would be laughably horrible.
Wheat
New York City residents each consumed about 24kg of bread per year. It would take about 8.6m square metres of floor space stacked three high per floor, to grow New York City’s wheat. That’s equal to nearly three Empire State Buildings. It might seem very efficient to produce all the bread in three large buildings, but constructing and running them will have their own environmental footprint.
Assuming the use of efficient red-blue LEDs at $0.10 per kilowatt-hour, production alone would cost about $327 (£223) per square metre per year. If turned into bread it would cost $11 per loaf of bread to cover the lighting cost.

Yes...It is techniques like these that could permit the earth to feed 12-15 billion souls but there is a GIANT caveat. These high-productivity techniques are very sensitive to a failure in the chain. Loose lights for an hour and the entire crop is ruined. However, the cost of production is so high the desire to send it to market regardless is very high. It is a double edged sword.

[–]DeusMexMachina 1 point 14 days ago 
I am an R&D engi for one of the largest indoor growing/greenhouse lighting companies. The title here is a tad misleading as the jury is still out on the efficacy of spectrum specific LED lights. In this case, LED suppliers are using the term "optimized" without any actual data to support any increased plant growth. In fact, while LED tech is improving, they still lag far behind conventional HID lighting in actual plant mass production. LED does provide benefits in energy usage and temperature management, but still has a ways to go in the growth department.

[–]Oznog99 1 point 14 days ago 
LED are notably more energy-efficient. Plants don't absorb the green part of the spectrum, not for photosynthesis anyways.
They'd nice for smaller grow tents in that they don't produce so much heat. Plants grow better in cooler temps and when people put MH like a foot away from the crown of the plant the heat becomes a problem. In a larger facility the MH could be higher up but for space reasons they'll probably want to stack them on racks with the light source closer up.

[–]DeusMexMachina 1 point 14 days ago 
You are correct about the greens for the most part...the issue is that the blue/red LEDs are deficient in a lot of areas of the spectrum, and UV, which the impact of is only now being sussed out and identified. Don't get me wrong, LEDs certainly work, and are perfect for leafy greens in a low height rack setup. But for pure biomass production they aren't there yet. There's a reason why HPS DE is killing it right now, and that is production quantity and quality. The energy savings is there, but ROI is much longer than they are touting, due to smaller 40-65% biomass yields.

[–]Oznog99 1 point 14 days ago 
Yeah the wavelength mix is super-complicated. Well, it's hard to study. The plant growth period is very long and chemical composition is difficult to test for, and we don't know the whole story on chemical function.
The most meaningful result was just putting a plant in a sealed bell jar with an O2 meter, and giving it different wavelengths of light. When O2 increased, photosynthesis is happening.
But that's short of the whole picture. Deep red doesn't really fuel photosynthesis but is necessary for flowing. Certain IR wavelengths don't produce photosynthesis themselves but increase the rate of photosynthesis from red/blue light (Emerson Enhancement Effect), and I'm not sure if anyone's worked out why.
We do know certain chemicals (not even sure if they're "nutrients") require wavelengths of light other than the photosynthetic red/blue to form. How much, what time... it's all a complicated, hard-to-measure mess. If we knew more about the underlying chemistry we could give answers that might take 20 years of growing and testing to figure out. But the biochemistry is super-complicated and varied and hard to get any info about.

I live in a small country town and here, as in many small towns, there are quite a few vacant buildings left by failed businesses and so on.

[–]psifos 1 point 14 days ago 
While this technology is energy intensive to be sure, there are other positive trade-offs that ultimately will reduce energy consumption by the system itself that most here haven't mentioned. Most notably, locating agriculture systems closer to the consumers. Food has to travel hundreds, sometimes thousands, of miles to reach the grocery store, using oil. Tractors moving up and down fields use a tremendous amount of oil. By reducing what is referred to as 'food miles', you are reducing energy usage - that is going to be the really revolutionary thing about indoor agriculture, along with water efficiency - the most important resource once we move away from fossil fuels.

[–]defecti6969 1 point 14 days ago

[–]SquidCap 1 point 14 days ago 
Hmm, lettuce has a lot of water, hell it almost is just pure water (~96%) and uses very little nutrients. That 1% is a bit dubious claim. Since we can say that if you use every drop and for some miracle, you get 100g of lettuce from 100g of water, that is 1%. Outdoor growing must then use 100 times more, 10 000g or 10 liters per 100g of lettuce. It can be true but sounds a bit odd when your product is mainly water, it may be a bit of math trickery :)

With such environmental controls, this looks like a place where growth patterns could develop. I wonder how different each head of lettuce grows.

I'm working with one of the owners of Growtainers. There are a lot of vertical farming systems, but his recently got a federal grant to continue development. With his concept, you can grow produce closer to the store. Because plants are growing until the minute they are picked up, they are perfectly fresh, and there is essentially nothing lost to spoilage. Grocery stores also save money on shipping.
HEB's Central Market has set aside funds to test these in two of their stores (both are Dallas locations), so you may soon see some hydroponic, organic (yes, it can be both) lettuce that's grown in the same building you buy it.
He's experimenting with several different plants, but some of them will be shipped to the UK for further manufacturing. His system includes the ability to control temperature, light, humidity, and CO2 levels.
Phillips makes a series of indoor lights, and there are 8 basic recipes, each with varying amounts of red, blue, and UV. In general, UV helps make vegetables more flavorful, because the oils are often produced as a response to UV damage, similar to the way we tan.

[–]lucksmithy 1 point 13 days ago

Efficient veggie gardening, I guess. I don't have much space in my yard but I want to make the most of what I got. Any ideas?

[–]LNMagic 1 point 13 days ago* 
Yes. One is more complicated for the controls (two timers), and the other is more complicated for plumbing / frame construction (everything mounted on a slope). Which method would you prefer?

[–]lucksmithy 1 point 12 days ago 
I don't mind building a complicated one, as long as it would be easier to maintain over the years. Which one would you recommend?

[–]LNMagic 2 points 12 days ago* 
Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) would be simpler. You just run pumps 24/7.
RACK: The bottom shelf (1) is level. It holds a tote for water recirculation, and perhaps a propagation area for new seedlings (probably not a big deal for home use, but for starting seeds you don't need much light). Shelves 2-5 will be sloped in the opposite direction, about 1% (1 inch per foot). Looking at it from the front, you'll go left, down, right, down, left, down, right down. The top shelf (6) is level, and does not hold anything on top. Racks 3-6 have strip lighting mounted to the bottom.
GUTTERS: You should use plastic gutters to put the actual plants into, if you can find something along those lines. You may have better luck looking for a hydroponic store in your area than at Home Depot, although you'll likely need parts from both. As for plumbing, you'll need a bulkhead fitting and flexible hose between each layer. PVC piping is prone to breaking from the stress if you move them too much. Make certain the tubing (probably 3/4" - 1" ID) is black to avoid algae growth.
TOTE: You'll need a low-profile tote to store the water in. If you have a Container Store near you, that's the easiest way to find it. Look for something that's already black on the outside - letting light inside the tote is likely to get you algae.
PUMP / PLUMBING As for the pump, you'll want something along the lines of a submersible pond pump. That line will go to the top, into a manifold (cheap source: Harbor Freight), and then to however many gutter lines you opt to put in your rack. For example, we have 5 gutters on each layer, but that's 30" wide. You may want something smaller for your parts.
LIGHTING: We use professional-grade Phillips lighting that is tailor-made for different groups of plants. You don't have that option. Instead, you can make your own pretty cheap using strip lighting and setting it to pink or purple. If you like, you could also add in a UV strip, although UV LEDs may not have quite a short enough wavelength to do everything your plants need. You'll probably want to get several strips. You can get a 3528 repeater so that everything still works off the basic controller. These should be so bright with pink or purple that when you walk outside, everything looks bright green. Yes, everything.
CO2: I cannot recommend boosting CO2 in a living environment for safety reasons.
LIQUID FERTILIZER: This is where I am not able to help. I'm certain there are some forums that can lead you in the correct direction, but I have absolutely no idea what concentration to use, or how to test it. What I can recommend, however, is that you place each plant you want to use in a hunk of rock wool. Last thing: don't plant anything that bears a heavy fruit. There isn't anything holding the roots down for stability.
Any other questions?

Lettuce has almost no calories, though. Call me when it can do rice.

[–]Ildarionn 2 points 14 days ago 
Almost no calories FOR A HUMAN. I don't see why rice would grow differently tbh.

I'll bet my reddit account that won't be profitable in 5 years (I doubt it ever was).
Also, Japan only uses about 20% of it's habitable land. This myth that Japan is running out of space is fodder for children that don't want to know better.

[–]alkizmo 1 point 14 days ago 
Japan only uses about 20% of it's habitable land.
Source? Japan is VERY mountenous. There might be a difference between "habitable" and "usable for construction".

[–]9291 1 point 14 days ago 
http://www.chacha.com/question/how-much-of-japan-is-habitable
About 75% is mountainous and unusable for agriculture and development.
So 25% is (either development for housing or agriculture). But only only about 4% of that land is used.
The fundamental problem in Japan isn't the geography, but the regulations that disallow any deforestation. Essentially, paralyzing development and creating awful housing gridlock.
Cultural roots point to Shintoism and a lack of a concept of "dominion" (that people control the environment). In Japan, the "spirit" of the trees and mountains are sacred. Some say it's just typical government over-regulating.

[–]alkizmo 1 point 14 days ago 
Ah ok thanks.. TIL I guess
I lived there for a year, but I only stayed in big cities, so I never saw big flat empty lands, however I saw a ton of forested mountains.
For a crowded place, they sure make the most of the space they use. I rarely felt like I had no personal space.

That's great but the infrastructure, overhead, and the data to make it even matter is probably a lot more costly than the most abundant natural resource on the planet and a piece of land to spray it on.

[–]Adamsan41978 1 point 14 days ago 
Pretty amazing technology but it's going to kill an entire industry of traditional farmers (as efficiency increases) unless they overhaul their methods. Companies like GE will make more as labor is cut out and more tasks are quicker and automated. We're seeing the possibilities of automation in nearly every profession. My biggest question is as profits go to large cooperations that can roll out savings worldwide, what are we supposed to do with the people that are phased out as an "inefficiency"? Not to get too political on an amazing technology post. I just wonder where it's headed financially.

[–]malvoliosf 2 points 14 days ago 
what are we supposed to do with the people that are phased out as an "inefficiency"?
Sigh.
Among the most viable of all economic delusions is the belief that machines on net balance create unemployment. Destroyed a thousand times, it has risen a thousand times out of its own ashes as hardy and vigorous as ever.
The belief that machines cause unemployment leads to preposterous conclusions. Not only must we be causing unemployment with every technological improvement we make today, but primitive man must have started causing it with the first efforts he made to save himself from needless toil and sweat.

[–]Muelldaddy 1 point 14 days ago 
Someday, I envision cities with towering greenhouse markets. Exterior glass embedded with piezo-electric cells captures solar energy, powering all the LEDs and water pumps. Food grows on flowing hydroponic flumes near the windows. At the center of the building are the supermarkets where fresh produce floats past shoppers, and you can literally pick your tomatoes off the vine.
Now, Reddit, I ask you...CAN. WE. BUILD IT?!?

Once Japan switches from growing lettuce to growing weed then their economy will truly flourish.
Why do people eat lettuce anyway? I only like it once or twice a year on tuna sandwiches. Spinach or sprouts are better for everything else.

[–]syrielmorane 0 points 14 days ago 
While energy costs may be high, this is the future. We don't have enough land mass left to keep making new farms. The logical solution is to build indoor farms. This particular model is most sufficient when it uses natural sunlight. It can definitely be done there are plenty of models out there that show how you build the tower to maximise sunlight. We can even build the tower to rotate with the sun/time of day.

[–]Ur3rdIMcFly 0 points 14 days ago 
So, when can we do this with food?

[–]Le_German_Face 0 points 14 days ago* 
Meanwhile all industrialized nations have to burn food because they already produce more than is needed.
European supermarkets have to throw about 40% of their goods in the trash and that is not even all that is thrown away. In Europe alone every year about 90 million metric tons of food are thrown away. We don't need more economic food production. We already produce more than we can eat.

[–]TheHardTruthFairy 0 points 14 days ago 
Why can't we have something like this here in the US? I think this is marvelous and it would answer A LOT of the problems we have.

[–]DwarvenRedshirt 2 points 14 days ago 
We don't have the space constraints they do. I imagine in comparison, that farm's substantially more expensive to set up than regular farming.

[–]TheHardTruthFairy 1 point 13 days ago 
Imagine if we could use some of that space to create indoor farms like this but with solar panels. We'd have more space for other things.

[–]Samizdat_Press 1 point 14 days ago 
We do in a few places, but it's only a niche product that isn't really cost effective since we have plenty of space

[–]TheHardTruthFairy 1 point 13 days ago 
According to the article, though, it's more effective to grow the plants indoors.

[–]probablyhrenrai 0 points 14 days ago 
And this is why I continue to totally dismiss claims of an impending calamity caused by food shortages and overpopulation.
Well, that, and thefact that claims along the lines of "overpopulation will kill us all in the near future" have been made for centuries.
Actually, there's also the very significant detail that as the human population has grown, the global standard of living has generall grown with it. The positive correlation is pretty damn strong, and at the present the global standard of living has literally never been higher.
TL;DR: Stuff like this is the reason why I find claims of impending catastrophe by overpopulation laughable. We humans have consistently improved life for ourselves as our population grows, and that trend shows no signs of stopping.

It takes all the fun out of farming. I guess Japan is too small and crowded to really experience what growing a garden is all about. It's not just about feeding people, it's about digging in the dirt. It's about teaching your kids how to grow something and be proud of it. It's about enjoying the fruits of your labor while enjoying the labor put into what you're growing. It's sad we have come to this. Put down your technology and live!

It's actually a revolution in farming. If we can manage a better energy production, like hydrogen or solar we can reclaim incredible amounts of land from vegetation farming we can avoid using the soil into death.
We can also lower the cost of foods in cities like NYC, Tokyo, Chicago, Amsterdam, etc...
But I mention all this because there are TWO right now in Newark New Jersey.

[–]pwnguin909 1 point 14 days ago 
Probably because of the cost of real estate, Newark is p. rough around the edges

[–]zykezero 1 point 14 days ago 
It is in part because of Corey Booker, before leaving office for the senate he set up this situation in Newark in an effort to revitalize it. Part of it was to introduce new companies to the city, this being one of them. I am sure they cut them estate tax breaks and other tax benefits for locally hiring.

Or is it that nobody gives enough of a fuck about starving Africans?

[–]Novaskittles 5 points 14 days ago 
Crazy high initial investment and infrastructure costs, with no guarantee of enough return to continue operation.

[–]Aunvilgod 0 points 14 days ago 
You are looking at this from the wrong perspective. Point is that this could be a permanent help with initial investment. What I am really getting at is that imo with a few more years of heavy research it should be possible to build them in Africa and also give them the ability to maintain them and maybe even build new ones. It would be a fantastic way to negate the catastrophe that is the expansion of the Sahara desert.

[–]Novaskittles 2 points 14 days ago 
I'm looking at it from the wrong perspective?? I simply stated it's not economically feasible, you can't get the supplies to make it work. You need supplies to make it work, labor and materials don't just appear out of thin air.
And the original post was heavily filled with finger-pointing. You're instantly saying we don't "care about starving Africans" and are suggesting we give them a facility that will run itself into the ground nearly instantly, it is not at ALL a "permanent help" without maintenance and supplies.
AND on top of that, why are you getting all worked up? If this facility is a success (which is what we're waiting to find out) then we can start spreading them. We don't have to instantaneously spread an experimental farming process across the third world because it sounds so beneficial on paper.

Thank you for posting this. For years I've been telling family & friends this was possible, when I started to see set up grow for Cannabis, such detail to pH level in water, run off water testing (pH), cycles of light, respecting natures cycle and using low water or optimal water usage--- I thought why can't be grow some greens and tomatoes.
I simply was told I was a fool, and no one will ever do it. Cannabis people do it, hobbiest do it, and survivalist in some areas.
Why is it people are quick to shot down a awesome plan for greens, even call me crazy (even though now there's proof japs been doing it long before any of us) but they don't question the McDonald's/B.K and pharmacy opening up in a alarming rate--- but I'm the crazy for mentioning both things like its taboo.

[–]edcxsw1 -2 points 14 days ago 
Vegetables are only valuable when they absorb the sun's UV light to create vitamins and minerals. Eating LED lettuce would be almost pointless. Ever have a greenhouse grown tomato? It tastes horrible and has little nutrition

[–]otbflo 5 points 14 days ago 
U are slightly misinformed i think. Some Newer leds emit a little full spectrum light as well. Source? I know a guy who knows a guy... the hydroponics tasting crap has to do more with the soil and land and climate niuances. There is none.

[–]-retaliation- 0 points 14 days ago 
Soil has a huge impact on this, IMHO that's why it would be hard to scale this to more nutritional foods, you would need a system to change out the troughs with fertilized soil, have one set being fertilized while one set is used for growing and swap the accordingly

[–]otbflo 1 point 14 days ago 
I agree. You just mentioned the lack of uv and i wanted to throw in my 2 cents.

Why would you not just irrigate the plants with a water/fertilizer mix? Or grow the crops hydroponically or aeroponically and take soil out of the equation entirely? I don't think its as big a challenge as your making it seem

[–]-retaliation- 1 point 14 days ago 
I'm not talking about just growing a plant im talking about fruit and vegetables, they have a huge impact on the taste of your product, it's not like growing weed, if you grow hydroponically you end up with watery, non- nutritional crap for vegetables,

[–]Umbrifer 0 points 14 days ago 
S'only been my experience when the hydroponic system lacked regular and consistent fertilization. If you get the potassium, nitrates, phosphor and sulfates into the mix in the right proportions . Taste was no different or better than soil grown crops on similar fertlization schemes. And it wasn't even expensive fertilizer either.

[–]HomemadeBananas 1 point 14 days ago 
What about full spectrum LED's like the ones used for growing weed indoors? Don't those produce UV?

[–]Oznog99 1 point 14 days ago 
UV can't be used for photosynthesis. Several plants have been found to be responsive to UV-B, however, neither lettuce nor tomatoes respond to UV light.

[–]Umbrifer 1 point 14 days ago 
Plants make their nutrients from the minerals present in the soil / growing medium. Light is a factor in photosynthesis rate, not so much in nutritional content.
