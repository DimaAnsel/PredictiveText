[–]BELLI_DEVS 2 points 14 hours ago 
I would rather say : the more you see someone, the more average they look.

[–]notMyRealName420 2 points 13 hours ago 
But average is attractive.
Google image: average of faces

[–]iglyboop 2 points 10 hours ago 
Nah, see, the individual faces are usually more unattractive than the physical average of the complexion's features. The average is often more attractive because it doesn't contain any exaggerated features that are unique to a person. Melding the different faces nullifies these differences and you have a result that is worth more than the sum of its parts.

[–]BELLI_DEVS 1 point 13 hours ago 
The average of faces is attractive because it removes defaults. The opposite happens when you see someone attractive in real life for a long time : you start seeing all their defaults.

[–]notMyRealName420 1 point 12 hours ago 
What do you mean?

[–]BELLI_DEVS 1 point 12 hours ago 
By taking the average of faces, the default of each face fades out. Which makes the face attractive.
When meeting someone attractive, you don't see their default. But with time, you notice that small scar. Those slightly crooked teeth. The asymmetry of the body. Anything that makes the person not perfect. And then you start seeing them as just another human being and you find them average.

[–]straechav 3 points 9 hours ago* 
Dude. I think you mean faults. Because as far as I understand English, default means something completely different.

[–]BELLI_DEVS 1 point 3 hours ago 
Yes, sorry. In French they're the same word.

[–]Gehalgod 1 point 2 hours ago 
He may have just mixed up "defect" and "fault" to form "default".

[–]Tora-B 1 point 7 hours ago 
I think the word you're looking for is "defect".

[–]BELLI_DEVS 1 point 3 hours ago 
Right, sorry. In French they're the same word.

[–]Second_Foundationeer 1 point 11 hours ago

It's the first IP address handed out by a typical router. Your whole network typically shares a single external IP, and ask of the request are passed through the router. The router gives every computer a local IP address (creating a mini internet inside your home). The first computer you hook up to the router is usually given 192.168.1.1 as it's "mini-internet" address

[–]lomelyo 4 points 15 hours ago 
To be honest I'm not sure which language I was writing on, just copied what I gathered from the post above. Figured that even if I tried to have the code make sense it would be wrong anyways, so I went with wrong but easier to understand.

[–]newstudent_here 2 points 14 hours ago 
If(hottie.theAss.size() >= kFAT)
That returns the size of the ass of the hottie in question (assuming that hottie is passed into the function with the variable name hottie). It does this by first declaring which object you are looking at (OMG it's objectifying women!), then looking at its ass (assuming it isn't private), then calling it's size method.
We then compare that to the constant value kFAT, to determine if the size is greater than or equal to the "fat" size. If that is true, commence your booty plundering.

[–]lomelyo 2 points 14 hours ago 
I considered the fatness of the ass as a boolean not a question of size.
Like it gotta be a question if the girl has an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face, you get sprung.
So maybe If(hottie.theAss.isFat) would be enough.

[–]newstudent_here 2 points 14 hours ago 
Okay, well now we are assuming that the hottie, probably an instance of the girl class, has her ass as a public variable?
I don't know about you, but all the girls I've met tend to keep their assess private.
Plus, public variables are always sketchy.

[–]lomelyo 1 point 14 hours ago 
Yeah, but you can see the fatness. So maybe hottie.hasFatAss()

[–]newstudent_here 2 points 14 hours ago 
That works great! An accessor method that has the hottie request her own ass.

[–]Thecrazything 1 point 14 hours ago 
Wait, why is that ass a function and not just a protected variable?

[–]His_Fordship 1 point 14 hours ago 
Wait can you not just use - if(this.assSize >=kFAT){Return true}

[–]grape_jelly_sammich 1 point 15 hours ago 
hahah fucking A ;-)
perl maybe? Though apparently there are a few popular languages that are along the lines of....assembly made easy.
also, my question was mostly a joke. ;-)

No, they do not. They have a statistical advantage, but it is absolutely possible for the casino to have a bad streak where they lose money until they go bankrupt before their luck turns around.
Same idea as there being an 18/18/2 red/black/green odds on roulette, but it is still absolutely possible although highly unlikely that the ball could land all reds for a day or week, or month, or even a year.
The only absolute casinos have are on games like poker where they charge a flat fee or percent of the pot in return for facilitating the game.

A buddy of mine (who now owns a successful software company) wrote the voting web app for his university's student elections. He ran for office and won. He won because he wrote the software.
He's clever and vicious.
Edited to add: funny how many people seem so certain this didn't happen. There really isn't much I can say to convince otherwise except provide more context. Hell, maybe he lied to me...This was in the early 2000s which was a different time. Him and I were in ap comp sci and spent most of our time doing stupid shit, trying to write key loggers, etc. we went to different colleges, he became "all everything". Years later when his company was well on his way, he told me what he did. We were drunk, he was still nervous about it, terrified that it would come out.
In our industry there are people who are very successful starting their own companies. Some are lucky, some are revolutionary/brilliant, and others are driven beyond comprehension, some all three or a combo of two. This guy who did this is the third type. He's ruthless, driven, and very intelligent. Like I said, maybe he lied but I believe him capable of pulling it off.

Depending on how good he is, it wouldn't have helped. If you are the one writing the code, it's not that difficult to create a very hard to detect security vulnerability, and then exploit it. Even if it's found, you can always believably claim that the vulnerability wasn't intentional.

[–]Stuhl 183 points 16 hours ago 
Reminds me of some contest where you had to write a secretly malicious program. The winning program was a censoring program where you mark parts of a picture and it becomes black. The Clou: His program replaced the numbers of the colour code with zeros. Depending on the amount of colourness, the black consisted of tree values: 0, 00 and 000. You could then use a secondary program, to change these 0 to 1 to get back the censored Information in trinary greyscale, which is good enough for text documents.

[–]OK_Soda 120 points 15 hours ago

[–]sacesu 40 points 15 hours ago 
Imagine a picture editing program that lets you add black rectangles. You use it to censor out certain names from a sensitive document.
Instead of just writing a "0" over each pixel (turning it black), the program writes "0" "00" or "000" depending on the pixel's color.
So to every other program, its a black rectangle, since 0, 0000, 000000000, etc. are all still black. But if you read the file correctly, you can convert those groups of zeros into 3 colors: black, grey, and light grey. For a document, it means you could probably read the text.

[–]KaptanOblivious 12 points 15 hours ago 
I believe he was saying it was a program for blacking out sensitive text on scanned documents, for instance on top secret files being declassified. Instead of changing the image to a uniform black, it would allow the information to be retrieved.

[–]ivanmius 6 points 14 hours ago 
If you were to read the article provided by crossbowffs, the program is meant to be used to censor images, text, etc. When a region is censored, each pixel is made black. The tricky part is that each pixel has 3 numbers that give it color (ex: 255 45 51), so when he makes it black it changes to all zeros (ex: 000 00 00). The number of zeros in the 'black' pixel betray the original information.
White is (255 255 255) and black is (0 0 0). So you can see that after censoring, original black remains (0 0 0) and original white is now (000 000 000). Same color, but if you were to read the file in a special way, you could find the original information, especially if its black and white, like text documents usually are.
Even better, the decision to do it this way is defensible in code review. This way avoids certain bugs from file reading functions built into C.

[–]wral 4 points 7 hours ago 
How can you do that? If there is a pixel data consisting of three bytes there is no way you can write 00, or 000 in there. It's just number. So it would be just 0.

continue this thread
[–]MeinKraftt 2 points 11 hours ago 
Every dot in an image has a colour value, represented by a number. So 0 is black, 1 is very very dark grey, 2 is very dark grey, 3 is darkish grey, and so on.
This program modified images of text by turning censored parts black totally black, like this.
The trick is that for each dot, it set the colour to 0 if it was originally black, 00 if it was originally grey, and 000 if it was originally white.
All those values mean the same thing, of course, they all mean black, because 000 is the same number as 0. So the program appeared to work perfectly.
But it meant that he could write another program that looked at the colour values and turned the 000 parts back into white, and the 00 parts back into grey, and read the censored text.
This is an example of something that would be totally devastating to anyone using the program, yet very hard to detect, even if you were reading the original source code.

[–]KnowsAboutMath 16 points 15 hours ago 
tree values: 0, 00 and 000.
How would you store these as distinct values in any common data type for numbers?

[–]UnsubstantiatedClaim 15 points 15 hours ago* 
The PPM format uses the numbers 0-255 to display the intensity of the RGB values of the pixel. The program changes the value character by character. So intensities 0-9 become 0, 10-99 become 00, and 100-255 become 000.
The values are stored and read as characters, not numbers.
Edit: why this matters:
You can then convert the black box back into a grey scale image with three intensities by converting the zeros back to higher numbers: black: 0, grey: 99, and white: 255. For something that was already black and white (like text) you get full fidelity.
Original:   255 255 255 0 0 255 0 255  
Censored:   000 000 000 0 0 000 0 000  
Uncensored: 255 255 255 0 0 255 0 255  

[–]dumbducky 12 points 15 hours ago 
Reading the creator's blog explains it better. The format of the image file is RGB encoded in ASCII. So a black pixel is 255. Rather than changing the string to 0, it changes it character by character to 000. This allows an approximation of the original value. If the original image was black and white (0 or 255) it can be recreated perfectly.

[–]buster2Xk 3 points 15 hours ago

So if you wrote a program for electronic voting, then let everyone proof read the code for any errors or security problems, do you think that all the programmers in the world with free time would be able to find any faults?

[–]c8220 13 points 14 hours ago 
I'd bet they could find any unintentional bugs fairly easily. It becomes more difficult when the programmer attempts to make the code incomprehensible and hide the bug.
But even if the code is demonstrably perfect, if you don't control how it is compiled and on what hardware it is run, it's all for nought.
There's the famous hack Ken Thomson described where he modified the login program of the unix OS to accept the user's password or his backdoor. Of course this bug would be immediately noticed by anyone browsing through the source code, so he modified the C compiler to recognize when it was compiling the login program and insert his backdoor code. Now perfectly innocent login code generated a broken program, but the modifications to the C compiler were still visible in the source code. He then added another exploit to the compiler so that it would recognize when it was recompiling itself and automatically insert both explots. He then removed the offending code from the source code since it wasn't needed anymore. In the end he had two dangerous exploits in both the compiler and login program without any traces of code.
You could theoretically take this hack as deep as the computer hardware itself.
The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.) No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using untrusted code. In demonstrating the possibility of this kind of attack, I picked on the C compiler. I could have picked on any program-handling program such as an assembler, a loader, or even hardware microcode. As the level of program gets lower, these bugs will be harder and harder to detect. A well installed microcode bug will be almost impossible to detect.

Until it can be shown that you profited off of it.

[–]twistedcain 2 points 13 hours ago 
it's not that difficult to create a very hard to detect security vulnerability
Rough example,
Web pages have the ability to send data through the URL in what's called a GET variable, similar to "&test=11". "test" is the name of the variable and "11" is it's value. Programmers are supposed to check each GET variable to make sure it's a proper value. Forgetting to check variables is what causes a majority of what people refer to as hacks, exploits, vulnerabilities or you what have you.
A real world example of this is an online game I used to play where you could send chat messages to other players in game. There was an interface for this built into the game, but you could also chat using console commands in the game to chat. The programmer limited how much text could be put into the text box, but forgot to check the length of the text when it was entered through the console. I discovered that if I entered a really long string of text in the console it would cause the server to restart and kick all the players off. If everyone pissed me off, I could boot them all off. This mistake was in a game that probably cost over 10 million dollars to make.
Back to my original example, of the hundreds of variables a website might pass back to itself through GET variables, it would be easy for a programmer to 'forget' to check one of those variables. Even one variable unchecked could allow the programmer to maliciously modify the database by sending instructions (code) with the GET variable that tells the software to modify something in the database. Even if they found the unchecked variable, they would have no way to prove that you made the modifications. Unless of course you built a complex tracking system into the software, which of course, if you're the programmer, you could simply modify that as well.

[–]Just-so-story 1 point 15 hours ago 
Lets put aside for a moment that, that story didn't happen.
Something as simple as a university voting app could easily be audited by one or two other programmers or a Professor who is capable of writing code.

The university doesn't really care who wins elections. The elections only exist so Type A people can compete for something and put that on their resume. The school puts them in charge of stuff they don't really care about so they get free labor but no actual risk. The day that chancellors or administrators get elected is the day they start auditing their software. If a university really cared about something, they certainly wouldn't let kids run a popularity contest to see who gets to do it.

[–]OK_Soda 27 points 15 hours ago 
At my university, the student body president oversees a budget of something like $12 million. The president, along with the senate, deals with things like city-wide bus transportation (the city has no bus system of its own and simply relies on the university's), multiple university-wide festival-type events that spill over into the city, building renovations that cost millions of dollars, and other important and large-scale activities that the university certainly cares about a great deal. It's not like high school where you just have a meaningless title with no power or responsibility attached.

[–]Gymnocalycium 27 points 15 hours ago 
I think you'll find there are administrators or regulations behind the scenes that prevent the students from doing anything the university administration really doesn't want them to do. Choosing bus routes or which musician to hire for the yearly events is something the administration doesn't really care about and is happy to let the students decide since the point of both of those things is to make the students happy -- but if they choose the wrong musician, of course the university will override them.

[–]AdamPhool 8 points 15 hours ago

[–]OK_Soda 4 points 15 hours ago 
Yeah, I'm sure. Mine is part of the UC system, so it's quite large and every facet of it has large operations with a large budget that comes under a lot of public scrutiny.

Paper ballot is counted by machine A, and then counted again by machine B (written by a different vendor than machine A). Machine A and B better have the same number of votes, otherwise you count the paper ballots by hand. Vendors of machines A and B are fined (and potentially disqualified, if their counts are really bad).
Seems pretty simple.

Doesn't work when all parties collude. The fines are offset by the windfall received when the election is won and they're paid handsomely for their collusion by the winning party.

[–]Brillegeit 1 point 13 hours ago 
Representatives of all nominated parties oversee the counting. That's how it's done here in Norway in the parliamentary election. I worked at a voting location a few years and there were representatives from all parties observing the ballot box and everything else going on from the doors opened until they closed. The ballot box seal was then checked for tampering, emptied and the votes counted by multiple people while being observed by 15+ people, where a representative for each party noted the number of votes for each party. The numbers were then reported by phone to a central location so a preliminary winner could be made in just a few hours. The ballot box was then re-sealed and transported by an official and a witness in a taxi to the town hall for the secondary counting and verification with the number of registered votes at that location.
Since all invested parties can observe both the voting, and the counting in a way where they can count themselves, any cheating would require a massive number of involved parties. Voting are normally held in schools, city halls and other fitting venues in all parts of the country with just a few hundred or thousands of voters per location, so in order to make a significant impact, a lot of these have to be infiltrated.
I can't guarantee that I remember all details correctly as it's almost a decade ago, but it's close.

I'm operating from the principle that people wanting online voting are actually trying to implement something useful, though.

[–]Nyxisto 3 points 15 hours ago 
The problem with electronic elections is that a small amount of people can affect an insane amount of votes, there simply is no way around it. If you install auditors who audits them?,
Manipulating paper votes will always involve a proportional amount of people in regards to the number of votes you manipulate.
Voting needs the highest amount of safety possible, electronic voting is a bad idea. Given the fact that you'll probably vote only a few times every few years there is simply no reason that would justify the risk.

This would not be a problem for national elections. Someone would double check the code because, unlike university elections, some people care about national elections.

[–]brickmack 1 point 12 hours ago 
Countries tend to have slightly better quality control than schools, at least in theory. And in the case where they don't, they'd probably find a way to commit election fraud regardless of the method

[–]SupremeHug 1 point 6 hours ago 
Well you have to trust either the software or the people counting the votes

[–]Alikont 2 points 6 hours ago 
Usually there is a lot of people counting the votes, like dozens per each station. And they all are from different parties/backgrounds.
It's hard to buy or convince them all to rig the election.

[–]itonlygetsworse 0 points 15 hours ago 
You realize people are already rigging electronic voting booths all over the place right? I don't know why the media doesn't cover this shit.

I wrote a voting program for our junior high to vote if they liked Ross Perot or Bush or Clinton better. I was pretty proud of it, even on a local radio show. Back in the day when I figured I'd end up being a programmer.
Edit: Ross won in our school.
Oh, I totally forgot I also wrote a batch file that downloaded all the locker combos for our school. (The vice-principle needed help with his spreadsheet.) I tried a few lockers to see if it worked, it did. Bit I was too good of a kid to do anything with it. I think I said I needed to help optimise the spreadsheet, opened up a DOS prompt and copied all .xls to my 1.44 disk.

[–]GYP-rotmg 5 points 15 hours ago

[–]WheresTheGotcha 2 points 12 hours ago* 
Nope, back in the day my mom paid for a computer tutor (keep in mind this was Apple IIe for me). Worked on arrays and some very basic stuff, but I ended up getting a video internship. It just so happened this was when non-linear video editing was just coming out. So my talents with computers and video matched up and I ended up getting a full time gig.
Funny thing is that I'm still bitter about how the teachers pulled me put off another class to yell at me and basically threaten me that I should not be trying to test the security of their network instead odds fixing the problem. Back then I was proud of myself and had no harm intended, more just trying it out.

[–]brickmack 1 point 12 hours ago 
Fun fact: if you ever need to rob that school, those locker combos probably still work. Most lockers only have 3 or 4 combos that actually work and they just rotate them once a year. So unless they've renovated since then they shouod still be valid

Today I learned that Leonardo DiCaprio risked hypothermia, ate bison liver, slept in an animal carcass, actually killed some guy, got AIDS, cut his hand while filming but then kept filming anyway, traveled the world, went 6 days without food or water, solved and fully explained Quantum Mechanics including finally finding a unified theory for all forces in the Universe, ended world hunger, reduced the homeless population to zero, cut his hand while filming and kept acting as if he didn't cut his hand, died, came back to life, was blessed by the Pope, found the Holy Grail, ate nothing but potatoes for an entire year on Mars, cut his hand while filming but didn't stop filming and kept going as if he didn't actually cut his hand, stop breathing for one hour and suffered permanent brain damage, actually sold drugs on the street to random people for realism, accidentally got shot on set but didn't stop and kept filming anyway, suffered a laceration on his hand for which he did not stop filming for and pretended that he did not get cut, fell in a black hole, ended the global climate change debate once and for all, while filming he got a gash in his hand from glass he was working with but pretended he wasn't actually cut and continued acting, artificially induced type 1 diabetes, cut off his leg on camera, ate out two chicks at once, put a bag on his hand and claimed he wasn't famous anymore, during a scene he was filming a piece of glass embedded itself in his hand which broke the skin and caused him to bleed but he continued to film as if nothing had happened, cut off both his hands and reattached them, became a Somalian pirate, stole the Declaration of Independence, destroyed the Death Star, prevented an alien race from taking over Earth, saved the President's life, and allowed Matthew McConaughey to have a small cameo for 3 seconds, and he did all of this for his new movie coming out soon The Revenant because Leonardo DiCaprio knows that the best acting is no acting at all.

It's the standard doucher post when someone finds the TIL post to be an intentional repost of something popular. Steve Buscemi working as a firefighter and Leo Dicaprio cutting his hand during Django are examples of other popular posts commonly resubmitted. This type of comment is quite ironic since it's nearly always the top rated comment and the same exact snark; thus, doing the same lame thing it purports to criticize.

Why would a computer program need to be written to seat kids in classes?

[–]RapesBuffalos 111 points 18 hours ago* 
I'm assuming when it says "sitting" with female students in class it doesn't mean the students were literally signing up for a chair in the classroom, but is used as a synonym for attending the class.
When scheduling classes in college, there are often numerous sections of the same class. You have to balance your schedule so that the classes you choose don't overlap with any others. This means you have to carefully select certain sections of certain courses.
In the past, people had to go through all the courses offered every semester, find out all the times they were offered, and calculate when they could take them - essentially, creating their class schedule by hand. If students were lucky, there was an office assistant who helped them, or did it for them.
Nowadays (and I'm sure this is what Bill Gates created for his school) we have software applications that will calculate all these times out for us so that we don't have to. It will generate schedules for us.
Bill Gates was just sneaky in that he modified the code so that the female students were put into the classes he signed up for.

[–]Throw_Away_One_Day 69 points 18 hours ago 
I'm guessing you didn't read the article. It was for high school, and it was to save the councilors time. The councilor just put what all the students wanted to take, and it found a way to make them fit.
In the past, people had to go through all the courses offered every semester, find out all the times they were offered, and calculate when they could take them - essentially, creating their class schedule by hand.
This is still pretty common, until 5 years ago I would say it was still more common. My university just released a schedule optimizer this year.
Even using the optimizer though students still get to chose between hundreds of different schedules. You just get to sort them by stuff like "time off campus", "days off campus", etc. So it wouldn't work well at all on a college level.

Mine spits out thousands of possible schedules based on what days you want off, what classes you want to take, and what teachers you want. Then you go through and start deciding which sections you definitely want to narrow it. It's quite useful, and my school is so big there's a massive variety

[–]JohnGillnitz 5 points 15 hours ago

Gather around kids, Uncle SprayDan is going to teach you a lesson on the ladies and college.
On the first day of class, don't get there early. No! Get there a minute or two before class starts. Stand at the front, look up at the lecture hall, find the best looking girl, and sit next to her.
Then you actually have to talk with her. You're on your own there.

Silly /u/redditgoogle, virginity is a property unique to every human, so it should be an instance variable, not a static variable.

[–]trai_dep1 3 points 14 hours ago 
I considered it. But Virgin being the original state, "0" being the unpowered bit, and null describing most CoSci majors' romantic life experiences (yes, I went there), "Virgin" = "0" seemed the optimal choice.

What's funny about that is that he was so fucking uncomfortable around women.
I wasn't there, but my parents have stories. One of them is about the friend they had looking over books at a store when he came over and stood next to her. He then followed her around, not saying anything, just trying to get her attention. Finally, creeped out, she left. At some point someone that was there told her who it was and her response "fuck". Because she would have given him a shot... since he's rich.
Also, why did they need to steal the account for more computing time? Because he and Paul used all of the schools prepaid time over one weekend. Lakeside did well afterwards, though. Surprisingly, if a few of the richest people in the world went to your school, they give you some cool shit back.

The Internet would not have happened without Netscape Navigator and LAMP. Microsoft was rather famous for betting against the Internet.

[–]Garrosh 1 point 5 hours ago 
Before Netscape there was Mosaic. In fact, the original Internet Explorer was based on it. And the first web server ran on NeXTSTEP, an OS based on BSD.

[–]not_better 1 point 2 hours ago 
The "information era" started way before the internet ever took off. Microsoft was already famous for being the #1 choice of OS and office software about a decade before Netscape became known and used at large.

[–]LvS 1 point 2 hours ago 
Yes. If Microsoft had had their way, we'd still be using Office and Encarta on computers that aren't networked.

[–]not_better 1 point 2 hours ago 
You seem to ignore the fact that Microsoft DID have their way and are still leader in office productivity software, including online computing, sharing across networks and just about every modern online feature you can think of.
It started in the early 90's with networked OS'(Windows for workgroups), file/document sharing, server OS' (Windows NT 3.1, 1993), domains... in what world do you live in that MS wanted the computing world to be offline?
Please back your claim, I'd really like to know about this "offline" way of MS doing things.

[–]LvS 1 point 2 hours ago 
Here's your sources.
And nobody back then ran Microsoft software for anything networking. It was all Novell Netware.
Microsoft included just enough code so they could mark the "network-ready" checkbox. Heck, NT 3.1 didn't even contain a TCP/IP stack.

[–]not_better 1 point 1 hour ago 
From the Windows NT 3.1 wiki : "Designed as a networking operating system, Windows NT 3.1 supports multiple network protocols. Besides IPX/SPX and NetBEUI, the TCP/IP protocol is supported allowing access to the Internet"
Source listed in wiki.
Are you for real? Beside the fact that Novell was very popular, plenty of people used MS software for networking, my then employer included.
So what you are saying is : -MS would have wanted the world to be offline (not right) -Ok then, it was networked but not much. (not right) -Well, it couldn't even use TCP/IP (that wasn't popular then) (not right)
Here's a quote from your source : "After the book was written, but before it hit bookstores, Gates recognized that the Internet was gaining critical mass, and on December 7, 1995 — just weeks after the release of the book — he redirected Microsoft to become an Internet-focused company; in retrospect he had "vastly underestimated how important and how quickly the internet would come to prominence".
So, an internet-focused company, that supports MANY types of network, creates domain standards still widely used today and is still innovating at every turn, is focused on offline Office and Encarta?

[–]LvS 1 point 1 hour ago 
You're aware that the book came out after Windows 95 was already released, right?
And you're right, NT 3.1 contained a TCP implementation. One that didn't work and that nobody used. And then you had to find (or hope some software shipped with) a proper Winsock implementation because that was what everybody was using. But yes, it was good enough to mark the checkbox and apparently get a mention on Wikipedia.
With Windows 98 Microsoft was serious about the Internet. They still hadn't understood it (did anyone actually use Active Desktop?) but they were now trying hard to bully Novell and Netscape out of the market with their proprietary extensions to HTML, most famously ActiveX controls.
And after they had managed to do that, the web browser world came to a standstill and no innovation happened (which allowed Flash to gain a foothold) for quite a long time.
Applauding Microsoft for the Internet is like applauding the US for world peace: It's correct as far as written history is concerned.

[–]not_better [score hidden] 49 minutes ago 
Applauding Microsoft for the Internet
Applauding Microsoft for the Internet is ridicule and stupid. To ignore the fact that it was Microsoft, with all of their previous OS and software, that put modern computers into the homes and business of just about everyone is stupid too.
You're quick to bash Microsoft for being (mildly)late for a network protocol, yet fail to mention what was the better alternative back then.
Was it Novell, that ran on DOS? MacOS that wasn't better networked and magnitudes more expensive? Maybe a UNIX variant with all of its user-friendliness?
Microsoft wasn't serious about the internet in 95 because the internet wasn't big in 1995. TCP/IP stacks, appropriate dialers and competent software to network were available and used on Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and everything thereafter. I've installed all of these solutions on those OS when the Internet took off for real, and Windows never failed to provide an appropriate platform to make it work, quite reliably for the time too.
On what OS were YOU using a GUI, TCP/IP and the internet before 1995 to despise Windows so much?
Windows (an operating system) has just about nothing to do with the advent of the internet. The fact that a boatload of people already had computers (+90% DOS and Windows) made using the Internet popular and possible for everyone.

[–]crozone 0 points 6 hours ago

Back in the day my employer (a medium/large company) decided that time clocks would be a good idea for us, computer people. Even worse, they would not pay overtime, but managers would give you shit for the smallest things.
I was put in charge of the system that copied data from the branch offices to headquarters (yay to compressed files and uucp). One day I discovered that the compressed text files generated by the time clocks for all employees was being copied by my system.
I was praised for my punctuality from that point on until I left the company a year and a half later.

Actually, Bill Gates's whole story is awesomely fascinating.
Really, in most people's minds he's this crazy smart computer god, but when it comes down to it he was a determined yet privileged and lucky individual.

Now, I just feel inadequate. He might not be the best looking guy but he used his brains to compensate. I'm not the best looking guy and I haven't done anything to compensate lol

[–]SubSoldiers 1 point 13 hours ago 
Story goes that he almost got it in with a few of the girls. However, after unzipping his pants they quickly found out the meaning behind "Microsoft".

Gates was a real geek, and ran the company well. Ballmer was a salesman that, while making tons of money, ran MS into the ground.

[–]old_to_me_downvoter 1 point 12 hours ago 
What I find more amazing in stories like this is that the school actually gave the student's software a chance.
I know that "times have changed" but when I was in High School in the late 90's, I would have been laughed out of the office, or put on some "Known Hacker" list had I come to the school with any software I had written.
So maybe instead of spending millions on "enterprise" software, you give students a chance to get some real world experience by writing some trivial stuff for schools. (Maybe they do that now a days, but they sure didn't when I was in school)

we wrote the report card/grading system as a project in computer science and put so many back doors in it. Mostly we'd just use a local copy to print off a card kids could bring home and show their parents. 5 bucks a pop

you guys circle jerk around this guy, but his greatest accomplishment was to screw everyone over so that windows ended up dominating, not with better product but with better marketing and subversive tactics that literally undermined others products via sabotage and outright theft.
and now we all get to enjoy being exploited, and too many fools actually worship this man, that if we had more of him would really make the world suck.
