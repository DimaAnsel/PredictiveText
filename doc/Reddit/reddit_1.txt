We’re still experimenting in this space, but an example would be a keystone mastery that lets your damaging abilities also bleed enemy champions for a portion of your bonus AD and AP over time. Or one that grants a movement speed boost the moment you deal a large chunk of damage to an enemy champion.
bleed enemy champions for a portion of your bonus AD and AP over time.

[–]Towelrub 2 points 13 days ago 
So much emotion expressed in such few words.

[–]blob-dob-11 1 point 13 days ago 
With this change, everyone is a blood brother. :o

[–]OBrien 29 points 13 days ago 

[–]BossOfGuns 8 points 14 days ago 
bonus AD, so it doesn't pack nearly as much punch as it does now.

[–]kilpsz 3 points 13 days ago 
This so couldn't have been the solution to nerfing old draven passive, nope nope nope.

[–]ploki122 6 points 13 days ago 
 Oh  sweet  another  damage  source  that  scales  with  200  bonus  AD 

[–]Raw_Stanky 4 points 13 days ago 
Darius and Talon will have a field day with that

[–]WalkToTheGallows 2 points 14 days ago 
Bring his old passive back for the double bleed :)

[–]velrak 1 point 13 days ago 
jsut give draven bloodcyka ult as passive on his q, should be totally balanced.

[–]PixieConspiracy 1 point 13 days ago 
Or do the old strat of giving red to Draven and letting a single auto half health the supp level 1.

[–]Kadmoz 2 points 14 days ago 
Oh dear...

[–]hbgoddard[hbgoddard] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
That + the new AD starting item that gives bonus gold every few minion kills...

"we’re removing Stealth Wards from the shop so teams will need to rely more heavily on their pink (and blue trinket!) wards to get the vision control they need."
oh my

[–]TehEpicKid 1988 points 14 days ago 
Well that's one way to deal with vision bugs

[–]Pwyff 816 points 14 days ago 
Reinboom has actually done a huge sweep of SR's map geo to solve for a lot of vision bugs / line of sight things with wards. This is just very high level for now.

[–]IE33 775 points 14 days ago* 
I can imagine, Reinboom; "Hey, I finally fixed all vision bugs in-game!.." Rito: "Ye, that's cool, but there ain't no more wards in-game"

[–]Reinboom 780 points 13 days ago 
Oh dear, and the person who removed green wards sits right next to me. That jerk. ;_;
More accurately though, sightstone still exists as well as trinkets. Wards are still very much a thing. :3

[–]AlonzoCarlo 94 points 13 days ago 
upgraded yellow trinket still available? to set 3 wards

[–]Cyllid[Only Trundle] (NA) 42 points 13 days ago 
It sounds like that for now.
I wouldn't be surprised if that changes functionality slightly and doesn't exist in its current state by the time preseason starts.

[–]Lymah 2 points 13 days ago 
Well its upgrading automatically and starting with 2 wards, so there's that

[–]MeowTheMixer 1 point 13 days ago 
But with out being able to purchase wards, I think the stealth totem may gain some traction for the consistent deep vision. So there may not be as many yellow trinkets.

[–]Xyltin 14 points 13 days ago 
I think the pink ward trinket will get removed. It would make no sense to keep it when you need the normal ward trinket to be able to place some.

[–]VoroxMaster -4 points 13 days ago 
There is no pink ward trinket. Are you talking about the regular ward trinket?

[–]DoomDuckXP 7 points 13 days ago 
He's referring to the two choices for upgrading the yellow trinket. Can go either Green wards or Pink wards.

[–]Xyltin 4 points 13 days ago 
There is a pink ward trinket. If you are lvl 9 you can upgrade the yellow trinket to either have 2 stacks and a 60 sec CD or to have a pink ward. It is called Greater Vision Totem.

[–]Teemonomicon 2 points 13 days ago 
You high?

[–]BlueWarder 1 point 13 days ago 
Yes and it seems like the upgrades could even be free:
we’re doing things like free trinket upgrades for all

[–]DumplingChow#SKTWIN 1 point 13 days ago 
Nope the yellow trinket upgrade has been removed AFAIK

[–]spirited1 0 points 13 days ago 
That will kill sightstone. It replenishes and costs less than sight stone without taking up an item slot. The only downside is that you lose your pink and won't have a sweeper, so you may have to rely on allys (lol yeah right)

[–]BrapYeah 2 points 13 days ago 
Sightstone is getting upgrades though.

[–]aksine12 3 points 13 days ago 
wouldn't want all that hard work to go to waste .

[–]gazeebo 3 points 13 days ago 
Since the possibility to pay money to see the enemy jungler killing his first buff was too cerebral, let's remove that. Yay.

[–]Shavark 3 points 13 days ago 
More accurately though, sightstone still exists as well as trinkets. Wards are still very much a thing. :3
The cap of wards should be increased to 7.
a cap to 5 from sightstone, two from upgraded yellow trinket.
I feel this would allow supports to flourish again. Normally only 1-2 people get sightstone (normally one in solo Q)
And that would leave at most 11 wards down at once if EVERYONE on the team upgrades too double yellow (Which is highly unlikely)
Pink ward should still have the 1/1 cap though, I think that makes the game more entertaining.
Giving supports the chance to place 7 wards down at once (Stacked at 5 from sight stone, so you can't do recall homeguard shenanigans and trinket capped at 2) Would help the warding problem lower ELO's might face from other lanes no longer warding because greens aren't purchasable.
Or, maybe increase the warding cap in a Matery point on the support tree!

[–]Sire_Q 0 points 13 days ago 
That's not allowing supports to flourish, that's allowing them to dominate. You would need oracles to be brought back to clear that much vision, and there's no way that will happen

[–]Shavark 1 point 13 days ago 
oracles to be brought back to clear that much vision, and there's no way that will happen
That much vision? I'd say it would be the same since green wards are no longer purchasable! (Less wards WILL be placed on the map because of this) Supports need a way to bounce back from this situation.
I think its a fine idea, warding will never be as insane as it was in season 2 and I laners will just stop warding in general, Most ADC's go Blue trinket and buy greens. (Good buy adc green wards)
Mid and top are the only two lanes I could see getting upgraded yellow trinket. (+4) And if supports can now place 7 that would give a total of 10 wards being present at once.
10 wards is not a lot, and give or take the extra yellow trinket, I think it's a fine cap.
I just think their should be a way for supports to carry the vision again when needed. Greens being deleted from the game is pretty huge deal IMO. They were a cheap source of vision that was very valuable for its price.

[–]Rolvak 5 points 13 days ago 
BURN THE HERETIC. BRING BACK OUR GREENIES. WE DEMAND A TRIAL BY VISION BUG.
I don't know wth i'm saying. Props on working on the vision bug anyway! :D

[–]chenhanlin 2 points 13 days ago 
so basically the value of supports have gotten higher while this forces the rest of the team to get with the program and buy pinks and use their trinkets :3 good job!

[–]PinkestPieNA 1 point 13 days ago 
as a support main, ty based reinboom <3

[–]hardcorefeeder 1 point 13 days ago 
I thought sighstones were gone, thank you jesus ;_;

[–]rakidori 1 point 13 days ago 
Wouldn't this be indirect nerfs to stealth champs?

[–]Noob3rt 1 point 13 days ago 
What prompted the removal of wards? More blind face checks? Making it harder to gain vision control and prioritizing more on the trinkets and pink wards? Spill your secrets Reinboom!

[–]Euphyacin 1 point 13 days ago 
Why would this change be made when it'll obviously turn into 3 people on each team buying sightstone? Isn't the meta going to look NO different than when almost the entire team sat on heart of gold for an entire game? Game constantly goes in the wrong direction.

[–]solidfake 1 point 13 days ago 
Doesn't that force junglers to go sightstone?

[–]fortevn 1 point 13 days ago 
Is the limit for pink wards stay the same? Thx.
I guess this change shouldn't be as seriously as people think. Right now the "warding role" are pretty much Jungler and Support, whose green ward source is usually from sightstones anyway.
The supposedly role to take a hit from this was top (or in some cases, mid) but now they can buy wards trinket instead of sweepers. (mainly for their teleport)

[–]tsc_gotlNotice me senpai 1 point 13 days ago 
D...D...Dawngate's system?
Am I dreaming?

[–]p-one 1 point 13 days ago 
'Map geometry bugs' sounds like an engineering blog entry I'd be really interested in reading!

[–]Dashing_Snow 0 points 13 days ago 
Trinkets are not enough for early game vision especially for solo lanes.

[–]rg44_at_the_office 3 points 13 days ago 
I agree. And as a support main, I usually go first B with ~950 gold. I could get SS and just hold onto the extra gold, or I had the option to grab mobility boots and wards and get back to lane sooner. Now it looks like im forced into the SS asap. :(

[–]XiXiS5 3 points 13 days ago 
That was strong.

[–]Highstalker 1 point 13 days ago 
holy shit, it all makes sense! they know they can't fix the ward bugs, so instead they just remove the wards!

[–]Sharjo 124 points 14 days ago 
Give Reinboom a raise dammit! She deserves it!

[–]Voidrive 59 points 13 days ago 
Nice try Reinboom.Rito pls, give her a raise

[–]folie1234 6 points 13 days ago 
Nice try Reinboom alts.Give her a raise tho pls

[–]Reddit_Amiibro 4 points 13 days ago 
How many alts does Reinboom have? Srsly Rito give her a raise

[–]barrybadhoer 1 point 13 days ago 
at least 4 appearantly

[–]PalePanda615 2 points 13 days ago 
You're all Reinboom!

[–]IMadeThisforMineZ 43 points 14 days ago* 
Why did you guys remove stealth wards from the shop? I'm glad you did, just wondering the reasoning. I watch a lot of Dota 2 where wards are way less common than in league and it's a lot more exciting imo with all the ganks so I'm wondering if this went into consideration

[–]Pwyff 89 points 14 days ago* 
Xypherous has a lot of thoughts on this, we'll throw up a dev blog in the dev corner next week on this very topic!
edit: lol I'm dumb: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/whbJ5lH1-the-preseasoning-day-1-open-forum-discussion

[–]Sprite_isnt_lemonade 3 points 13 days ago 
Doesn't this massively punish immobile champions? If I was playing a champion that was easy to gank, I would always prioritize making sure I had vision to protect myself. Now I have just pinks to use, and have to rely on my jungler to go sightstone and help ward for me.
Unless I'm reading this wrong, I'm a little disappointed.

[–]KbloeUIEOssa -2 points 13 days ago 
Generally the immobile champs outscale the mobile ones in teamfights so i think thats quite fair to be more vulnerable to ganks early

[–]ThisIsFlight 2 points 13 days ago 
I feel like their immobility already makes them vulnerable to ganks early. The stealth wards don't outlast their cool down and you only get one, where as there are usually more than one way to gank.

[–]IMadeThisforMineZ 2 points 14 days ago 
Thank you! Also thanks for changing up the game a lot! I've been playing less and less these past few months but these changes sound nice!

[–]Simetraa 1 point 14 days ago 
Will supports be able to place more wards? That is actually something I really want.

[–]akajohn15 1 point 14 days ago 
Havent read any of the changes but I feel like I might be happy being a jungler

[–]ploki122 1 point 13 days ago 
Wrong thread, here's the right one :
http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/whbJ5lH1-the-preseasoning-day-1-open-forum-discussion

[–]FlamingoOverlord 1 point 13 days ago 
These changes are making me sad Pwyff! Y u do dis to me...

[–]Guggsen 2 points 13 days ago 
Wards are way less common because five wards will cover the entire dota 2 map. The removal of wards seems really stupid to me.

[–]IMadeThisforMineZ 2 points 13 days ago 
No they won't. Have you ever played Dota? I mean yeah, without trees, 5 would cover the whole map but trees block most of a wards vision.

[–]Guggsen 0 points 13 days ago 
I meant without the trees yeah.

[–]IMadeThisforMineZ 2 points 13 days ago 
But that's a vital part of warding you can't just not include them lol.

[–]Rommelion 1 point 13 days ago 
Base shop in DotA also only sells a limited amount of wards. If you buy all of them, it takes time for the shop to recharge the stacks to sell.

[–]PenPaperShotgun 1 point 13 days ago 
Wards are less common because its more about wisps and tp's then vision control

[–]Stosstruppe 1 point 13 days ago 
yeah well, in dota 2 you can't just stock up on wards or buy an item that gives you wards. you get barely 4 wards on the map at all times, but you can drop a lot of sentries down but they are rather expensive at 200 per purchase (2)

[–]Median2 1 point 13 days ago 
How is Dota 2 to watch? Is it more exciting than league?

[–]Siantlark 5 points 13 days ago 
It's always going to be down to personal preference to be honest.

[–]Fahkeet 1 point 13 days ago 
It's up to you to decide.
Competitive Dota 2 has more action and more fights than competitive League of Legends, I'm sure everyone can agree about that.

[–]IMadeThisforMineZ -1 points 13 days ago 
Imo yes, even if you barely understand any tho.

[–]Craigellachie 0 points 14 days ago 
Dota's map is also considerably larger than SR and with the trees limiting sight and movement, vision is harder to come by and more important. In league the ubiquity of vision is probably a big factor contributing to the early roaming meta and limiting it will probably be a good thing for the game.

[–]feedmaster -4 points 14 days ago 
They aren't removing stealth wards. What the fuck? Can you people even read? They're only removing them from the shop. Sightstone and yellow trinket still exist and those two items were used for warding a lot more than actually buying sight wards at the shop. Removing them from the shop won't change the game by much, maybe just making sightstone a must buy on junlgers, which is already the case in competitive play.

[–]IMadeThisforMineZ 2 points 14 days ago 
My bad I meant from the shop I forgot to put it in. If they removed from the shop then early game warding is harder.

[–]feedmaster -1 points 14 days ago 
No it's not. It 's going to be even easier. Everybody is using yellow trinket for early game warding anyway and it's getting buffed. You will get 2 charges on a yellow trinket when you buy it.

[–]DarkEndless[NephaIos] (EU-W) 1 point 14 days ago 
Will you be updating other marksmen besides the six mentioned? Specifically, I'm wondering about Ezreal.

[–]Selling_Meth_add 1 point 13 days ago 
something tells me that you are working on something big with Clarity

[–]Sydney_Gamer 1 point 13 days ago 
Why on Earth don't you just have a buffer zone of a few pixels around all geometry where wards can't be placed? If you click a ward inside that zone it just pushes it out slightly. Problem solved...

[–]Rakorn 1 point 13 days ago 
What is gonna happen to lee sin and ward jumps?

[–]rg44_at_the_office 1 point 13 days ago 
SS and yellow trinket aren't being removed, you just can't buy stealth wards individually anymore.

[–]HipHopIsAlive 1 point 13 days ago 
When are you going to implement team builder for ranked....?

[–]Dashing_Snow 1 point 13 days ago 
So uh need more info on what exactly is replacing green wards because otherwise if I'm winnning lane I can completely control vision with a single pink.

[–]AceOBlade 1 point 13 days ago 
but I am an adc with ward skins :(

*MAP GEOMETRY

[–]ThePirateTennisBeast 0 points 14 days ago 
I feel this will become a new meme

[–]feedmaster 3 points 13 days ago 
Well, it would be, if it actually meant wards were going to be removed from the game, but since yellow trinkets are getting buffed and more junglers will probably buy sightstone, there will probably be even more wards on the map. I mean just think about it. How many times does top, mid or adc actually buy stealth wards?

[–]Hisiru 2 points 14 days ago 
Thats a good way to buff akali I guess

[–]LexaBinsrhidden baguette 2 points 13 days ago 
I think it is more of a way to deal with champions like Evelynn and Shaco.

[–]Vlaed[Mowzer] (KOR) 1 point 13 days ago 
Sir, how do you want us to fix this ward issue bug? "Just remove them from the game."

[–]Ocoro 1 point 14 days ago 
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

[–]Pwyff 667 points 14 days ago* 
You'll see a few changes to support this rather than a raw "strip wards out." Pink wards, for example, are getting cheaper, trinkets automatically upgrade, and sweeper has some new functionality. We'll have more details next week!
[edit] Big one: Yellow trinket starts with 2 wards automatically.

[–]Eternalmars 657 points 14 days ago 
trinkets automatically upgrade
PRAISE THE SUN
NO EXCUSE NOT TO WARD

[–]JDogg2K 421 points 14 days ago 
Upgrades were only 250, there was never an excuse not to ward.

[–]Mirkkatje 231 points 14 days ago 
You wouldn't believe how many people in low Plat elo tell me that they'd rather spend that 250g on damage than a trinket upgrade..

[–]ToiletTwinkie 103 points 13 days ago 
I often don't get upgraded trinket right away at level 9.
Its just when I recall, and i buy items with the gold I have, if I have 250 leftover, then I upgrade trinket. There really should be no excuse to save that gold for a damage item because its 250 gold you could be spending right now.

[–]SuperCharlesXYZ 24 points 13 days ago 
I always try to upgrade it, but i realise i forgot to do it again when i'm already back in lane. Then i realise i'm lvl 15 and should've gotten it 10 minutes ago

[–]vXvInfinityvXv 3 points 13 days ago 
yep, what's happening to me aswell. In lane: I dinged level 9 next back I have to remember to upgrade trinket. Level 15: fuck I forgot to upgrade trinket again. I'll do on the next back. Nexus destroyed: FUCK, I FORGOT IT AGAIN!

[–]Mirkkatje 3 points 13 days ago 
Using Championify's itemsets helps with this a lot as you will have the trinket upgrade options right there in the itemset view of the shop! You can even make Championify put them at the top of the itemset to make them as visible as possible.

[–]vXvInfinityvXv 2 points 13 days ago 
Oh thanks, I'll try it out.

[–]DwayneFrogsky 1 point 13 days ago 
amen

[–]The-ArtfulDodgerFrostbutt Darius 3 points 13 days ago 
I'm usually waiting for the moment I hit level 9 so I can go upgrade my trinket. So cost efficient and at level 9 its a huge powerspike considering most other players do not upgrade.

[–]Mirkkatje 5 points 13 days ago 
Honestly, if I play mid and I can choose between a piece of an item or the trinket, I always go for the trinket. It allows me to farm safer, poke safer, and if I want to, all in safer. Much better than a bit more damage imo.
Only finishing a core item takes precedence for me, but if it's a choice between a Blasting Wand or a trinket upgrade, I'll always go for the trinket. I'll have more than enough for that BW next time I back anyway, thanks to all the glorious stress free farm I've gotten :p

[–]Kanopanda 2 points 13 days ago 
Oh hell yes, this is exactly my thought on this. Providing more safe-laning to get back up to buying whatever you need is honestly better to waste that 250 gold on.
I am a support main so warding on a mid laner is just a second job for me to do, and its really sad when I outward our support with my trinkets... But I'm using my trinket for it's effective price so theres that.

[–]Mirkkatje 1 point 13 days ago 
Warding comes so naturally to me that I hate the levels 1-9 without an upgraded trinket, lol. I frequently outward supports with just the upgraded trinket too. I don't know how people play this game without warding, I get scared near unwarded bushes if I don't know where everyone of the enemy team is. ;_;

[–]MelThyHonest 1 point 13 days ago 
I think mid benefitted the most from the trinket upgrade, your trinket is never enough to ward mid safely and I rarely see junglers willing to help. I kinda see the upgraded trinket as a necessity in mid.

[–]Mirkkatje 1 point 13 days ago 
I feel the same way in the top lane though, the lane is so long that if you're in a bad position, a well timed gank can be devastating. Depends on what you play of course, but my current go-to top laner is Lissandra and I still upgrade my trinket instantly at lvl 9, even though it's pretty easy to get away from ganks on her!

[–]iSheepTouch 3 points 13 days ago* 
That's because the 250g right at lvl9 isn't always worth it for the trinket upgrade since that is the time when you are generally finishing your first big item and laning phase is still in full swing so wards are mostly for jungle ganks at that point (and IE is worth more in lane than an extra ward if you don't have the funds for both). It should be done as soon as reasonably possible but the ward Nazis think that since they see 16 wards on the map at any given time in worlds that they are all you need to win games and start raging at anyone who hasn't upgraded their trinket by lvl10.

[–]eSportWarrior 1 point 13 days ago 
Its a must for me as a Top or Midlaner. The Jungler won't be able to gank anymore its so efficient to have 3 wards down.

[–]MaOreo 1 point 13 days ago 
I play a lot of jungle and I always try to upgrade it as soon as I hit 9. I feel the vision it brings at such early time is great, letting me to counterjungle knowing where everyone is.

[–]420OnMy69th 1 point 13 days ago 
I recall level-9 to upgrade it and pick up a pink.
Seeing as I rush HG's on most champs, I leave lane a lot to apply pressure.

[–]soopse 1 point 13 days ago 
It's also 250 gold you could be using to stay alive with the extra wards, giving you more gold towards a damage item.

[–]felipeleonam 1 point 13 days ago 
1 thing i do is just buy a ward, some pots and maybe a pink if needed. Not upgrading your trinket isnt the worst thing in the world. If you don't feel like upgrading it asap just get a ward and a pink. Youll still do plenty till the next time you back.

[–]Hurenschande 1 point 13 days ago 
Plan your recall in a was so you have 250g over

[–]IAmYourFath 1 point 13 days ago 
Buying the trinket is way better than a cloth armor / tome / long sword for example. Having vision is superior to some little stats at level 9. On the other hand, if you need the gold to upgrade 2 long swords into brutaliser for example, then yeah.

[–]coldhandz 19 points 13 days ago 
Plat 2 right now. It doesn't get better. In fact, I swear Gold players were more diligent about this.

[–]Qualine[Hawke] (EU-W) 5 points 13 days ago 
Well I was at silver, gold and plat this season and I can easily say that most of the gold players I matched with are more intellegent than those scrubs(peps who doesn't buy upgrades) in platinum.

[–]DontLickThePurple 3 points 13 days ago 
Been climbing pretty fast through silver(4-1 in a matter of days.) The closer I get to gold the worse my teams get. Its surreal.

[–]Qualine[Hawke] (EU-W) 3 points 13 days ago 
Well, mid to high gold players (3-1) are the best players that I've encountered with, but silver is pretty much poor mans platinum (this statement works both for game and reality lol), they are both flamers, who thinks they deserve to be challengour, and think highly of themselves, but gold is like safe heaven, at least thats the case in my experience.

[–]420OnMy69th 1 point 13 days ago 
Gold II is ELO Heaven. Everywhere else fucking sucks. Or maybe it's just my experience. That was the nicest, most stress-free ranked games I've seen.
Funny what you call silver, when I call plat "shinny silver" and bronze "shinny gold" because that's how I feel they are.

[–]Sikletrynet(EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
Indeed, G3 currently, and i feel people actually have been warding a lot more lately lol

[–]dragonmilking 1 point 13 days ago 
I'd say Plat 2 players ward but don't upgrade. Gold players upgrade but don't seem to actually place their wards....
You get supports with 6 wards placed in an entire game even though they had a sighstone

[–]hardcider 1 point 13 days ago 
sounds about right, honestly it probably comes down to a person by person basis. Someone that ends up supporting not by choice (ie last pick) probably doesn't care that much and just wants to get into a new game.

[–]SippyCup090 1 point 13 days ago 
Even in diamond 5 - 3 games I've experienced plenty of people on both teams never upgrading their trinkets until like 30+ minutes. As a support main it's the most frustrating thing in the game having to constantly ask your team to upgrade trinkets and help with vision.
People are selfish and generally don't care.

[–]JinxsLover 3 points 13 days ago 
Prolly cause most people in low plat(plat 4 here) got here on being mechanically better then a majority of gold-bronze and see no reason to change things such as better warding or working with the team instead of going solo(the vayne effect)

[–]Mirkkatje 2 points 13 days ago 
I feel like a lot of people in plat think they are good at the game for getting out of the bronze/silver/gold bracket and become arrogant as fuck because of it, and then they just absolutely refuse to admit that they still have room to improve

[–]JinxsLover 1 point 13 days ago 
sounds fairly accurate, also i think most people know they aren't good enough to get diamond so they just don't try to improve in that regard

[–]corylulu 1 point 13 days ago 
I got to plat doing the opposite, actually. Being pretty mechanically average but focusing on vision control, good zoning, recognizing and punishing mistakes, and objectives... It's just a lot harder to climb like that because if your team won't listen, group for objectives, or pay attention to vision, then it's all in vain.

[–]JinxsLover 1 point 13 days ago 
yup that is why i said most, i think plat is about the ceiling for being mechanically good where it takes something more to get diamond

[–]FrnFreeze 3 points 13 days ago

[–]IAmYourFath 2 points 13 days ago 
Even in diamond only 2-3 people every game actually upgrade their trinkets early on, even though you should upgrade it asap, the value is insane. Vision wins the game by itself.

[–]ailetoile 1 point 13 days ago 
That doesn't make me feel better. I'm a silver support main and I feel like a broken record reminding my teammates to upgrade their trinkets and actually use the stupid things. I keep holding out hope that it'll get better if I can climb the ladder, but...

[–]Clamidiaa 1 point 13 days ago 
I main supp like yourself I'm guessing with the Nami tag. Anyway, I would literally tell people to upgrade their trinkets. I always upgraded at lvl 9 to the better sweeper and everyone else wouldn't even think of upgrading their trinkets or buying a certain trinket till they are lvl 18. It boggles my mind.
I tell each lane which trinket they need, that they need to upgrade it and they basically won't do it in spite of me telling them to. It's really annoying.

[–]FlowahFaitharino 1 point 13 days ago 
Bro it's that way all the way into D3. We can be crushing the game, everyone will have tons of cash and still no one will upgrade that trinket. Or we can be way down and vision is a cheap way of getting picks and back into the game. Still no one upgrades.
When I'm forced to play off my support role then we'll have an upgraded trink because I always do that. Vision wins games. Anyone who watches any pro league games can see that. So much of the battle is getting vision control. But even into mid diamond 250g seems to be just too much of a barrier to people.

[–]zzerooo 1 point 13 days ago

[–]meripor2 1 point 13 days ago 
I played a game earlier in low plat vs a graggas/zed duo who were intent on invading my jungle and pink/green warding everything. All I did to counter was smite my raptors on cd to clear their wards and upgrade my trinket to ward my entrances. By the time mid game ended they had spent so much gold on pink wards I had an entire item up on their graggas.

[–]thebeastisback2007 1 point 13 days ago 
Or homeguard boots at 8 mins so they don't miss that 2 cs

[–]Gymleaders 1 point 13 days ago 
This EXACT thing happened to me last night. I told everyone to upgrade their trinkets since it was late game, and my mid laner said "I'd rather save for void staff".

[–]Eternalmars 5 points 14 days ago 
It upgrades automatically, meaning i don't have to remind my teammates every 5 seconds to back to base and get the ward upgrade.

[–]It_Smells_Like_Frogs 1 point 14 days ago 
Now just remind them that they HAVE the upgraded trinket, and remind them to use it.

[–]Saiyan_Vegeta_7 1 point 13 days ago 
in my opinion even if they buy it cuz you told them to do so they wont use it cuz they are not used to use it.

As an Akali player... I have until level 9 until I am useless. Before, people had to at least spend 250g to shut me down for almost the entirety of the game. Now it's free to destroy me? I'm practically useless till 6, and useless after 8.
So many Akali nerfs, both direct and indirect..

[–]Towaum 1 point 13 days ago 
Still have to find the button that places the ward.
For real though, I've had a silver ranked game where someone needed to be explained how the trinket works... 3-4 weeks ago... sigh

[–]TheCreat1ve 1 point 13 days ago 
No more "Guys pls upgrade trinket"

[–]Fluffy017 173 points 14 days ago 
Trinkets might automatically upgrade, but are you adding a "USE YOUR FUCKING TRINKET" ping? I'm getting tired of typing it out as support.

[–]n0notreally 5 points 14 days ago 
Agreed. In the reverse too, sometimes as ADC I have to ping my support to get them to put any wards. I have seen them wait until like 3 full items to get sightstone so basically I have to wait for my trinket to cooldown and that's all I get. It's like some people have a mental block about vision.

[–]akajohn15 4 points 14 days ago 
I feel like sometimes its hard for an adc to be on the samw line as their supp vision wise. Your supp might want different things than you

[–]n0notreally 2 points 13 days ago 
That's fair, I guess it all boils down to lack of communication. But if your support is literally just not warding at all, it gets annoying and you likely get camped when the jungle/mid lane realise.

[–]xxLetheanxx 2 points 13 days ago 
I agree. If we aren't going to fight or push I am not going to move from your side to put wards unless I am going to roam. Sadly people in low elo don't understand this.

[–]coldhandz 3 points 13 days ago 
I haven't reached that battle yet. I'm still begging my teammates to upgrade their yellow trinkets in the first place. I've started upgrading yellow as an adc right after finishing my Infinity Edge because the other laners weren't doing it, even 30 minutes in... It feels like vision control habits got worse as I got higher in Plat.

[–]The-ArtfulDodgerFrostbutt Darius 3 points 13 days ago 
Well now the players who don't ward at all, have that crappy 60 second ward - which they feel is enough.

[–]SuperCharlesXYZ 2 points 13 days ago 
i would pay money for RIOT to implement a ping like this

[–]JJaypes 2 points 13 days ago

OR

K thx.

[–]egotisticalnoob 2 points 13 days ago 
Instead of giving it just a regular old unique sound, like the other pings, the announcer should actually say "Use your fucking trinket!" This would be a very useful ping.

[–]I_have_one_comment 1 point 13 days ago 
Yeah, I'd really like both a "Please ward here" as well as a "There's a ward here" ping. So many ruined ganks cause I can't type fast enough.

[–]xxLetheanxx 1 point 13 days ago 
I just danger ping wards and type ward in chat. Hopefully my teammates are smart enough to understand that.

[–]Gymleaders 1 point 13 days ago 
Oh yeah? Well I'm tired of telling my support to use their damn trinket! Yeah! YEAH!

[–]Fluffy017 1 point 13 days ago 
To be fair, unless you're playing in high elos, sweeping lens is really hit or miss when it comes to trying to hunt down enemy trinkets
But if your supp isn't building sighstone...I'm sorry

[–]Gymleaders 1 point 13 days ago 
They don't even try though. They don't use it at all almost. This is in low diamond. However occasionally you'll get a support main that knows what they're doing.

[–]Fluffy017 1 point 13 days ago 
Good to know I have more of an idea of what supp should do at bronze elo than most supps do at diamond
now if only I had a competent adc to get me out of bronze... q.q

[–]Gymleaders 1 point 13 days ago 
I've actually come across a lot of silver players (not necessarily bronze but I feel it can still apply) that have really good mechanics (although they could've just been having a good game) on certain champions, usually Thresh, and beat me very hard. I've lost against a handful of low-rated supports. However, I feel like there's a lot of underlying issues. I've noticed a large one is some support players just don't know when to roam. They want to just sit bot with their ADC at second tower while their ADC freezes... Like why? That's my biggest pet peeve unless bot is actually being pressured.

[–]VoroxMaster 1 point 11 days ago

Then they reply "it's not my job to ward."
As they proceed to get ganked and die every 4 minutes.

[–]Specter1138[Specter 1138] (NA) 45 points 14 days ago 
Can you say anything about the blue trinket? It states that teams will need to rely on it more in the future. Is this intended to be with new functionality, or still as a temporary vision granting item?

[–]Pwyff 131 points 14 days ago 
TL;DR in this current iteration it drops a permanent 1hp visible vision ward (like a Pink but no stealth reveal) with a massive range. I believe the wards are off the cap, so technically if you drop them on cooldown in random places...

[–]-Noceur- 52 points 14 days ago 
If vision wards are being removed but there will still be sightstones won't this make vision control less a team effort and even more so the job of those with sightstones or are trinkets changing to accommodate this?

[–]mukomo 58 points 14 days ago 
With auto-upgrade trinkets (at the very least) I see that there will be a good amount of wards available to players.

[–]meripor2 2 points 13 days ago 
But it means if you want to upgrade to a red trinket you cant green ward anything. That means you cant agressively ward forward because if you pink ward it will just get killed.

[–]dHUMANb 2 points 13 days ago 
That's a reason for a team to not go with 4 red trinkets then.

[–]-Noceur- 3 points 14 days ago 
I hope so, it would be nice if all roles could contribute a lot to warding.

[–]MrMeltJr 6 points 13 days ago 
They could make sightstone cost 100 gold and still nobody would fucking ward.

[–]EyrieWoW 2 points 13 days ago 
They could give you 75 gold every time you put a trinket ward down and still nobody would fucking ward.

[–]MrMeltJr 3 points 13 days ago 
They'd just ward in fountain or whatever. Nowhere useful, certainly.

[–]McDouggal 1 point 13 days ago 
Pro meta was 4 sweepers and a blue. Yes, most pro teams went double sightstone, but still.

[–]hbgoddard[hbgoddard] (NA) 2 points 13 days ago 
Pro meta is 3 sweepers, an upgraded yellow trinket, and a blue trinket.

[–]McDouggal 1 point 13 days ago 
Was that at worlds? I stopped paying attention to worlds after the NA teams got eliminated. For most of NALCS, 4 sweepers and a blue was the meta.

[–]ManWithoutModem 2 points 13 days ago 
A lot of toplaners seem to get the upgraded yellow, yes.

[–]MelThyHonest 1 point 13 days ago 
I believe TSM actually had red trinket on sup/jungle blue on adc yellow green ward upgrade on top and yellow pink ward upgrade mid. But they were unique.

[–]ploki122 3 points 14 days ago 
Well, the warding limit will still exist, and the trinkets are now more accessible (so other players have more warding power). Pink wards are also, up to now, cheaper than before. So in theory, it should actually be fine.

[–]Theonetrue[Diamond] (EU-W) 3 points 13 days ago 
It will probably 100% force the play of only sightstone junglers in higer elo/competitive.

[–]xxLetheanxx 2 points 13 days ago 
I think on the LoL mothership site they said that they were working on ways for other roles to further opt into warding outside of trinket and sightstone.

[–]egotisticalnoob 2 points 13 days ago 
Sightstone will probably become core on most junglers.

[–]The-ArtfulDodgerFrostbutt Darius 3 points 13 days ago 
I hope not. This would be the opposite direction to what Riot described. Forcing the vision control into the Jungler's realm of responsibility.
Sightstone is already an inefficient purchase for a jungler (compared to their other gold efficient options). It works at the pro level but is considerably less effective in solo queue.

[–]It_Smells_Like_Frogs 2 points 14 days ago 
Stealth wards are being removed, and those are the green ones. Just making it clear.

[–]MrSenk 54 points 14 days ago 
Yeah, vision control is such a core part of the game, everytime they change something it feels totally different

[–]n0notreally 3 points 14 days ago 
It's a big change for support mains but 2 wards for free from the start means you can get your other items quicker which is great, and then the whole 'ward debris' thing seems like a good idea too. Could make supports and junglers a lot more powerful with the vision.

[–]MattMugiwara 1 point 13 days ago 
Ruined me as a support main. Played nothing but ARAMs to this season.

[–]quantum_titties 1 point 13 days ago 
That change was like 2 or 3 seasons ago, bro.

[–]MattMugiwara 1 point 13 days ago 
I should have said until this season. That change was pre-season 3. During season 4, I played few rift games at the begining, and none later. I went back to normals and committed to ranked just this season.

[–]Mintastic 1 point 13 days ago 
Yup, in some ways I miss it though when I play support because you could carry as support purely by controlling vision. Though on the negative side if your team falls behind then enemy support or jungler basically snowball the vision game against you and you're stuck spending every gold on wards.

[–]Gymleaders 1 point 13 days ago 
And the original support changes! Nerfs! Nerfs everywhere!

[–]feedmaster 4 points 14 days ago 
What the fuck? This basically doesn't change anything.

[–]Simetraa 0 points 14 days ago 
Hehehe... I remember some people saying this when they changed vision system before.

[–]feedmaster 5 points 14 days ago 
Sightstone and yellow trinkets will still exist. How many times do you actually ward by buying a sight ward at the shop? The only thing it will change is sightstone being a lot better on junglers, which already is mandatory in competitive play.

[–]tallboybrews 2 points 13 days ago 
These changes are huge.. but they are pennies compared to the implementation of sightstone and trinkets, and the change to what killing dragon and baron do.
Hell even the initial addition of jungle items was pretty big.

[–]rg44_at_the_office 1 point 13 days ago 
well they aren't removing stealth wards from the game, you just cant buy them individually from the shop anymore (and almost nobody did anymore anyways). Sight stone and trinkets are still there, yellow trinket now gives 2 wards at level 1, and all trinkets upgrade for free automatically.

[–]RavenHusky 2 points 14 days ago 
Still not a fan, because I swap to blue trinket at level 6 on Lux and still buy a ton of wards throughout the game, and I don't like the though of having to rely on blue to keep the vision I need, especially when I keep the enemy blue, dragon, and my lane bushes warded.

[–]thelightfantastique 1 point 14 days ago 
Hi Pwyff. Please make the baron eat that new monster if it is alive during Baron spawn.

[–]arkhammer 1 point 14 days ago 
Please just tell me that you won't leave supports in the dust with respect to vision. I'm a support main, and I love taking trinket, ward and 2 pots to lane for earlier vision awareness. If we're just going to be limited to trinket and more expensive pots, I feel like supporting the early game is going to get unnecessarily harder. We already have to deal with double teleport + jungler ganks ffs.

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 13 days ago 
The trinket will have 2 charges at start, so taking one won't be necessary. And I think that we'll have some changes in support itens too, to compensate it.

[–]Eternalmars 1 point 14 days ago 
Yellow trinket starts with 2 wards. Are they the cheap 60 sec wards or the 3 min wards?

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 14 days ago 
Probably 60 sec. 3 min would be TOO MUCH for free.

[–]Promasterchief 1 point 13 days ago 
dude as a jungle main I am already getting mad at this, how am I supposed to ever gank mid lane now?

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 13 days ago 
Very carefully

[–]Sharikx 1 point 14 days ago 
What's going to happen with Sightstone though? Is it getting removed aswell, or will it still be an item to pick up for people who want to support their team with vision?

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 14 days ago 
No, they'll be changed somehow. It seems that sighstone will be receiving a third tier too.

[–]GeneraIDisarray 1 point 14 days ago 
So you make ganks harder. AFK farm junglers incoming.

[–]symystry 1 point 14 days ago 
Pro invades will be even more annoying to watch

[–]Dark512 1 point 14 days ago 
Will early game vision be affected at all? There are a few champions (rengar, Evelyn and shaco for example) who you absolutely need the deep wards against, I don't think anyone wants to deal with that...

[–]SivHD 1 point 14 days ago 
nothing says "no fun allowed" like a healthy amount of free wards to throw into bushes you enter to make sure no1 ever dies, jukes, kills or has to take any risk ever.
giving people free wards instead of buffing wards made the game easier for the crowd but killed action and risks. now that change is being increased. I just dont understand what could possibly be the reasoning.

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 14 days ago 
They'll buff the red trinket, too. Since the yellow one are being that buffed, I can assume that red one will be massively buffed too.

[–]StealthSpheesSheip 1 point 14 days ago 
Can you guys make a "there is a ward here" ping? I'm tired of pinging a bush only for an ally to walk into it and camp it

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 14 days ago 
There was a couple assets in a PBE patch a long time ago that implied that they was going to implement it. But they get removed soon after.

[–]D3monFight3 1 point 14 days ago

[–]AsceLoL 1 point 14 days ago 
Does the Rift Herald buff transfer if the champion who has it dies?

[–]Random_Guy_11 1 point 14 days ago 
If yellow trinket starts with two wards, what happens when the trinket automatically upgrades? Three wards?

[–]Gifibidy 1 point 14 days ago 
If every player can start the game with 2 trinkets, thats 10 per team at lvl 1. Sounds great but won't that cause the first few minutes in pro play to be really slow?
The thing is if teams have so much vision at 1 minute into the game then won't that give them all the information they need to negate any kind of clever switcharoo to get the lanes they want? This also makes it really, really hard for a jungler to get 3 buffs and also makes early cheese strats and invades basically impossible.

[–]Tortillagirl 1 point 14 days ago 
I dont think ive bought a green ward all season, and im usually 2nd on wards placed when im not supporting, the yellow trinket upgrade is so cheap!

Meanwhile Eve is crying in a corner after getting also nerfed last patch for no reason

[–]_rothion 6 points 13 days ago 
Poor Evelynn. Especially since there will be no more mana potions too.
Cheaper Pink Wards? No problem, says Riot - we'll nerf her W.

[–]Careful_Houndoom 0 points 13 days ago 
I'm kind of confused.
Like I never run out of mana on her so I'm obviously not playing her correctly.

[–]_rothion 0 points 13 days ago 
Lane Evelynn. W recent nerfs.

[–]MomentOfXen 10 points 13 days ago 
Lane Evelynn
The hell is that?

[–]_rothion -2 points 13 days ago 
A viable playstyle. Especially if you play her as an Assassin, her intended role.

[–]bigbluefungus 1 point 13 days ago 
keane has a video on youtube of him going eve mid in diamond

[–]_rothion 0 points 13 days ago 
Alex Ich even picked her again sometimes this year
People just dont know that Eve Mid was actually meta before falling out favor.

[–]ovoKOS7 1 point 13 days ago 
Actually I'd argue that she's more a of dps skirmisher (and they already stated they were buffing mana pool/regen of pots-dependent champs)

[–]_rothion 0 points 13 days ago 
She's still an Assassin if you build her like one - plus I doubt that Riot would acknowledge her as a lane champion today

[–]ManWithoutModem -1 points 13 days ago 
A viable playstyle.
midlane nami is a viable playstyle, so is full tank vayne and full tank riven...just because something is viable doesn't mean it is going to be intelligent to utilize...

[–]_rothion -2 points 13 days ago 
LoL you're spewing nonsense.
Eve Mid just fell out favor due to heavy nerfs due to how good DFG was with her. Does not mean that is bad - or that there are not people still playing her as a laner.
Lane Evelynn trades early game to a strong mid and late - due to having atual Gold income and exp to afford a damage build.
If you're just here to hate on the character, stop. You'll be only make a fool of yourself in the process. ;)

[–]Tank_Kassadin7-1 Never Forgetti 5 points 13 days ago 
I think it's mostly a regional thing that Evelynn is getting nerfed for.
In NA she sits at 2% ban rate. And in Korea she is at 31.03% (previously even higher) The reverse is true for Morde, NA bans him 51.5% and Korea is only 3.5%.

[–]Asgardian111[Gotta Luv Lasers] (EU-W) 3 points 13 days ago 
Good, i hope she never leaves that corner.

[–]VunterSlaushMG 5 points 13 days ago 
Eve is tough. When she's strong, she's super fkin annoying and cancer to play against, when she's not strong, you can pretty much ignore her.

[–]DeathDevilize[DeathDevil] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
Eve was pretty obnoxious in plat+, its just the playstyle of the champion, its obvious that its gonna end up broken in soloq, you cant play like there could be an Eve in your lane all the time and warding wraiths is far from a counter, the time you waste walking there to ward it isnt even close to the amount of time she spends smiting them to kill the ward.

[–]tallboybrews 2 points 13 days ago 
But. but. the pros get sightstone on every jungler!

[–]Dske(BR) 1 point 14 days ago

:(

[–]safetyseal -1 points 14 days ago 
I assume Sightstone will be removed as well?

[–]Mirkkatje 7 points 14 days ago 
Why would it be? Quite the opposite, they might be bringing Sightstone upgrades to the table.
-- option for tier 2 support items to upgrade into either powerful tier 3 active items or slot-efficient sightstone upgrades.

[–]feedmaster 0 points 14 days ago 
No, which means removing sight ward from the shop changes almost nothing. Idk why everyone is freaking out.

[–]safetyseal 2 points 13 days ago 
That's definitely not true. A lot of people buy sight wards for laning phase. It'll make jungler's lives a lot easier.

[–]feedmaster 0 points 13 days ago 
Yellow trinket is getting buffed, so it won't. And a lot of people also don't buy sight wards for the laning phase which means buffed yellow trinket will make the junglers life even harder. Also, pink wards will be cheaper and laners can just buy that instead.

[–]WarriorMadness 1 point 13 days ago 
I don't know if it's because I'm a Support Main who's playing Top and Jungle more and more, but I buy a shit load of Wards every time, so it kind of is a huge change, but seems like an interesting one, specially with the other vision changes.

[–]SuperCharlesXYZ 1 point 13 days ago 
So i assume your lvl 1 trinket is going to keep the mid-lane warded?

[–]feedmaster 1 point 13 days ago 
Well, it's getting buffed, cause it's getting 2 charges lvl 1. Pink wards will also be cheaper and mid laners were usually buying them more than green wards anyway.

[–]CrashTheMexican 22 points 14 days ago 
I'm assuming that with removing stealth wards they're still keeping the warding totem? That along with the free upgrades to trinkets, I think we can survive...

[–]superguardian 5 points 14 days ago 
There's also reference to a blue trinket ward. Assuming the blue scrying orb still is around, maybe this is that mandrake ward they kept trying in the PBE.

[–]Mirkkatje 4 points 14 days ago 
Uh, why are people so confused by this blue trinket ward? Blue trinkets drop a 1 hp ward even now if you upgrade it at lvl 9....

[–]superguardian 2 points 14 days ago 
I don't really think of it as a ward in the same way the yellow trinket ward is, but you are right.

[–]Dr_BalancedFaith age 1 point 13 days ago 
I think they are also keeping sightstone are they not?

[–]norpser 167 points 14 days ago 
Season 3 - "we need to add ways to get more people to ward. Leaving it to supports makes them take all the blame"
Season 6 - "we are taking out wards. There are too many wards, people need to use pink and blue trinkets more"

[–]Chief_Master_G 152 points 14 days ago 
Sight stone is not going anywhere. More vision options are coming. Free trinket upgrades. They're getting rid of 75g green ward. That's it. There will be more vision, not less.

[–]maniacalpenny 37 points 14 days ago 
Free trinket upgrades.
This doesn't actually change the amount of vision for any team/player that isn't garbage.

[–]AP_RAMMUS_OK 7 points 13 days ago 
There were players at worlds with full builds and unupgraded trinkets.

[–]egotisticalnoob 2 points 13 days ago 
They must be in bronze! Oh wait...

[–]Chief_Master_G 17 points 14 days ago 
I play in high plat and hardly anyone upgrades trinkets. Maybe it's different in lower elo

[–]cracktr0 28 points 14 days ago 
pretty sure im the only person below challenger that upgrades trinkets.

[–]austin101123 4 points 13 days ago 
I am in silver and almost always upgrade my trinket just after hitting level 9. Many times I get to base, "ooh I can upgrade my trinket!!" ... "FUCK IM ONLY LEVEL 7!!!"

[–]Sikletrynet(EU-W) 3 points 13 days ago 
I second that one

[–]SleepyJoel 1 point 13 days ago 
I do and it baffles me why people don't. I was watching phreaks stream one day and at the end of it he did a q and a. During the q and a upgrading trinket wards came up and he was just as confused why so few ppl do. He went on to say that it was the most efficient way to spend your gold because it's a one time expenditure that allows you extra vision. Furthermore if you lay a ward that prevents a gank you save giving the enemy team 300g and on the flip side if you lay a ward that gets your team a pick you have paid for your upgrade plus some extra gold.

[–]EmilyGZ 3 points 13 days ago

[–]Ralkon 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm also D5 and upgrade really late usually. Between forgetting and backing on just enough to get big items I usually don't upgrade trinket until at least 2-3 items finished. But hey it's faster than most people I play with still.

[–]Alex1233210 2 points 13 days ago

[–]coldhandz 1 point 13 days ago 
As an adc main in Plat 2, I actually don't have much experience with the blue trinket, because if I don't upgrade yellow, my team doesn't have any wards on the map.

[–]trikillr42 1 point 13 days ago 
Lol it's not any different, I've played normals (which is the equivalent of bronze regardless of the actual rank of people playing there) and I've played from silver to plat and no one upgraded their trinkets ever, you basically had to yell at people late game to do it

[–]maniacalpenny 1 point 13 days ago 
Happens in low diamond too, but I consider that to be garbage. When I play serious games with my team we buy upgraded trinkets. When i play serious games I usually get my upgraded trinket between 9 and 11.

[–]Raptor112358 1 point 13 days ago 
If you remind your team in Plat they're typically good about upgrading their trinkets.

[–]RoyalC90 1 point 13 days ago 
Yeah I don't get it I'm only silver but I've had games where my ADC has 6 items, tier 3 boots, and elixer but still standard yellow trinket. It's like people go out of their way to avoid buying it.

[–]fromtheinside15 1 point 13 days ago 
thats crazy, my friends and I play in Silver on Ranked 5's and we all try to have upgraded trinkets by level 10 or 11 depending when you back. We average about 10-12 pink wards a game between the 5 of us also, what is the norm for plat level elo?

[–]Chief_Master_G 1 point 13 days ago 
Ranked 5's is a different game.

[–]n0notreally 1 point 14 days ago 
I am in silver and I think 90 percent of the time I am the only person on the team/in the game who has upgraded my trinket, or even warded much at all, even when I'm not playing support. Why don't people see the value of this? I've had to miss CS as ADC to avoid ganks and place wards.

[–]Rommelion 2 points 13 days ago 
That's good then. ~90% of players (gold and below) are garbage.

[–]antesignanus[Bobert Greater] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Can confirm, am Silver 2 and trash.

[–]Jooota 1 point 13 days ago 
Yellow trinket now start with 2 charges (or the non-upgrade version can have up to 2 charges), so it will help a lot. The problem will come when you have to decide between yellow/red/blue trinket.

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
Kind of? 250 free gold you can spend on pinks :D

[–]typhyr 1 point 13 days ago 
Having two wards on your trinket from the start of the game might help a lot though.

[–]MrMeltJr 1 point 13 days ago 
So I can't start yellow trinket, support item and 2 wards. Less vision unless my lane does well I can get an early sightstone.
And if I'm in a different role, that's only 2 wards I can have.

[–]dHUMANb 1 point 13 days ago 
Yellow trinket will now start with two wards. So support and adc will already have 4 wards between then lvl1.
Source: Pwyff

[–]MrMeltJr 0 points 13 days ago 
I don't want to have to rely on my adc warding.

[–]dHUMANb 0 points 13 days ago 
That's your problem, not Riot's.

[–]Mirkkatje 1 point 14 days ago 
Quite the opposite, they're giving everyone a lot MORE wards. Yellow trinket stay and trinket upgrades are free.

[–]aloy99 1 point 13 days ago 
Won't there be less wards after the roles other than support switch to scanner/orb since they can no longer place stealth wards? Why would anyone swap to orb or scanner then, if it's so crucial to stay at 3/3 stealth wards and 1/1 pink wards, if doing so completely prevents you from getting any stealth wards?

[–]AncientSpark 1 point 13 days ago 
I think it's still a balance. S5 had too many people warding, S3 had only support warding. Somewhere in the half-zone, where support does more warding, but everyone contributes warding seems to be good.

[–]JDC31 1 point 13 days ago 
You are completley misunderstanding what they are actually doing. They are putting more emphasis on the entire team warding by increasing things like yellow trinket starting with 2 wards in it. They are making vision more diverse while if anything making it more abundant

[–]EllisonX(EU-W) 39 points 14 days ago 
W E D O T A B O Y S

[–]D3monFight3 2 points 14 days ago 
Why?

[–]Hedg3h0g2 5 points 14 days ago* 
DotA has only one ward per team per 3 minutes. So basically the map is dark usually. There's also a consumable called smoke of deceit that gives invis to all heroes around the user that disappears once withing about 1 and a half auto distances of a tower or enemy hero. The item has a 10 min shop cooldown, as in each team gets to buy 1 every 10 mins.
Yes, in dota resources like wards share team-wide cooldowns. But you can also give them to an ally if you don't plan to lose them. You can also give them pots and give them the equivalent of crystaline flask among others(either 1 charge or transfer the item).
Leads to a lot more risky situations where you are trying to predict what the enemy is doing based on the vision you have rather than outright seeing them. And it leads to more kills. For example during MLG columbus, i think the only LAN that released team in-game voice coms, at times you'd hear someone say "I'm really certain that they are smoking X, get back".(for example this is the first one that comes to mind since i rewatched this video recently for some reason https://youtu.be/qrP4oey2_ys?t=16m33s , a smoke gets predicted with no wards on that side of the map)

[–]dnl101 9 points 14 days ago 
Wards in dota have a wayyyy bigger radius, last 5min and are more effective through the high ground mechanics.

[–]Hedg3h0g2 4 points 14 days ago 
They last 7 mins and you only got 2-3 out at a time. Counting the opponent doesn't deward. They reveal a lot more but then you also have stuff like gem of true sight and suddenly their winter wyvern/batrider is dewarding every single ward.

[–]qqcar 1 point 14 days ago 
but look at the size of the dota map... compare to league of legends

[–]DonationBox 1 point 13 days ago 
Still more effective because if you place them right they can see over trees and walls. Also because there's no red trinket, you have to either invest in Dust or Sentries (which nobody in trench tier buys unless there's a Riki on the enemy team) or a Gem of True Sight, which could be stolen by the enemy.

[–]ploki122 3 points 14 days ago 
Because DotA has no trinkets and sells invisible wards in the shop... or something.

[–]Dmienduerst 2 points 14 days ago 
Depends on the trinket changes but this is a great way to boost the power of junglers in turn.

[–]OperationCraig 4 points 14 days ago 
Oh. My. Fuck.

[–]feedmaster -1 points 14 days ago 
But why? It changes almost nothing.

[–]JustynNAJustyn [NA] 7 points 14 days ago 
What the FUCK. Trinket's better get buffed the fuck up then.

[–]RiotXelaadryth 138 points 14 days ago* 
For that first goal, we’re doing things like free trinket upgrades for all
:3
EDIT: Said this in another reply but:
Just wanted to call out that line since it's pretty important and not to be overlooked. Trinkets will automatically get more useful as the game progresses and you won't have to pay to improve them, making it less of a hassle of "oh did I remember to upgrade" and losing out on the huge benefits from getting level 9 yellow trinket, for instance, when all it is is a more potent level 1 yellow trinket.

[–]neenerpants 36 points 14 days ago 
Aw no. The fact that I upgraded my trinket was one of the only ways I could convince myself I was better than my bronze teammates. You took that away from me!! :(

[–]pm_me_rule34_kindred 23 points 14 days ago 
Now you'll have to actually use the trinket.

[–]FyB4rd 2 points 14 days ago 
don't worry, if you're even using it you're doing just fine :)

[–]fox112 24 points 14 days ago 
Mixed feelings on this.
It was already really cheap and gives HUGE rewards to the people willing to invest in vision.

[–]tostito1 29 points 14 days ago 
It's one of those things like jungle timers where I feel like it effects this weird pool of middle-skilled players who are hit or miss on it.
Top level players: whatever, everyone pretty much upgraded their trinkets ASAP anyway
bottom level players: this will encourage them to upgrade trinkets and use vision, which they probably weren't fucking doing before lol

[–]sxeQ 10 points 14 days ago 
Exactly. Like, in gold and silver I used to get a ton of free dragons because nobody would write out timers for them.

[–]Sangomah 2 points 14 days ago 
You can see the timer automatically now, so only really need to spell out Flashes and TPs

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
Dragon was basically always mine because the enemy team didn't get a free notification that I took it.

[–]NinjaChris098 2 points 14 days ago 
Agreed.
I'm a bronze support/adc who always upped my trinket at 9/10. Always. And even though I/we had a support with a sightstone and three wards out, people would just drop f-bombs telling me to ward more. It became demoralizing.

[–]Sangomah 1 point 14 days ago 
Even then, I place more wards as a mid main at low gold mmr than my support even when they HAVE a sightstone. I dont think this change will improve the warding habits of lower skilled players.

[–]mb9023 0 points 14 days ago 
Yeah but no no one can buy stealth wards, so your only warding will be down to trinkets and whoever has a sightstone. People will have to use trinkets to ward at all, so free/automatic trinket upgrade is huge.

[–]JustynNAJustyn [NA] 41 points 14 days ago 
:3
This is suspicious. Please explain further.

[–]RiotXelaadryth 21 points 14 days ago 
Didn't mean to be suspicious, just wanted to call out that line since it's pretty important and not to be overlooked. Trinkets will automatically get more useful as the game progresses and you won't have to pay to improve them, making it less of a hassle of "oh did I remember to upgrade" and losing out on the huge benefits from getting level 9 yellow trinket, for instance, when all it is is a more potent level 1 yellow trinket.

[–]PPCSpecialist 1 point 14 days ago 
Does this mean that Sightstone is being removed? You mean I have to rebind my trinkets for the likes of my terrible insec on Lee Sin? :(

[–]RiotXelaadryth 2 points 14 days ago 
Nope, to the contrary Sightstone is getting more variation in upgrades for supports, but Sightstone and Ruby Sightstone are still around!

[–]lenaro 1 point 13 days ago 
Can I just say I'm super pumped for merging sightstone with T2 support items, since the only T3 I really like is shurelya. Also, this change sounds great on supports like Zyra that often don't bother upgrading the support item.

[–]JustynNAJustyn [NA] -1 points 14 days ago 
What about early game in say, mid lane, where to be safe you need a ward on both sides of the lane? Usually you'd back with a ward, and ward/trinket both sides. But now you can only ward one side. Or a champion like Lee Sin, who buys wards early to ward hop? Isn't that an indirect nerf to him?

[–]RiotXelaadryth 4 points 14 days ago 
You can still get pink wards! And so can your jungler if you're playing all strategic-like.

[–]SimianSpectre 4 points 14 days ago 
I'm imagining you making airplane noises as you spoon feed this lazy guy information he could easily just read for himself in the link.

[–]JustynNAJustyn [NA] 1 point 14 days ago 
Man...ward hopping with Pink wards always makes me feel a poor guy spending all of my money on brand-name products.

[–]RiotXelaadryth 6 points 14 days ago 
Pink wards are cheaper now though, so you're not really missing out on anything. If anything you're giving money away! Well, to the other team for killing a ward. ;p

[–]JustynNAJustyn [NA] 2 points 14 days ago 
Reported for assisting enemy team. =(

[–]kDart007~Meep noises intensify~ 0 points 14 days ago 
But will the pink ward limit stay at 1?

[–]xxLetheanxx 1 point 13 days ago 
early game trinket starts with two wards confirmed by a red on the LOL mothership site. Also it appears that they might be bringing back jungle items that drop wards.

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
Yellow trinket is also starting with two wards now as well.

[–]McDrewbs 1 point 14 days ago 
Is anything happening with the basic trinket's free level 9 upgrade?

[–]Draki1903 0 points 14 days ago 
Please just make it an auto upgrade to Stealths with an opt-in for pinks.

[–]SWORDamocles 1 point 14 days ago 
Are they automatic? Because even free won't mean anything to some

[–]RiotXelaadryth 3 points 14 days ago 
Yup, they'll automatically improve!

[–]SWORDamocles 1 point 14 days ago 
Ooooooooohhhh baby

[–]NinjaChris098 1 point 14 days ago 
Thank you. As a bronze player who ups their trinket every chance I get (supp/adc), it made zero sense why I would be complained at when I had my 3 wards out on the map at all times.
Telling my team the benefits of upgrading trinket always was rewarded with a 'f*ck you'.
:(

[–]ivan510 1 point 14 days ago 
I mean its not like 250g is all that much:p will we still only be able to place 1 pink on the map?

[–]xG3TxSHOTx 1 point 14 days ago 
But do we still have to wait until level 9 to upgrade the trinket? Green wards are huge early game to help prevent you from getting ganked in lane.

[–]SilkMonroe 1 point 14 days ago 
But only at a certain level? I feel so lost when I lose vision of the paths around my lane, too scared that scary spider / cougar / monk is going to jump out and devour / bite / kick me :(

[–]RavenHusky 1 point 14 days ago 
The trinkets better get significantly buffed then, because as one of the few people that actually upgrades my trinket, I don't like going without my vision.

[–]gayteemo 1 point 14 days ago 
You guys really need to look at Teemo's traps again then. Instant upgraded sweepers at level 9 is pretty dumb on top of the pink ward change.

[–]Doctor_KY 1 point 14 days ago 
Hey, just my personal opinion:
I know riot is going ahead with the free trinket upgrades, since you guys have already announced it but I'd just like to remind you to buff sweepers somehow (perhaps killing reduce cooldown on it, maybe) since there will be a lot more wards in the map.
Another gameplay aspect I feel the need to mention is that in my opinion as a top laner, upgrading your trinket is considered good gameplay. And most of the time my enemy top laner does not upgrade his trinket, giving me an advantage in lane and in game. I'm not going to complain about anything since i haven't played through the changes, but I just ask you to PLEASE tell the dev team not to forget about rewarding good gameplay. The feeling I've been getting lately is that riot has been increasingly rewarded bad gameplay.
Again, that's only my personal opinion, reddit, feel free to disagree, but if you do, please do expose your point of view, for a healthy discussion.

[–]jacob_ninja_potato3 1 point 14 days ago* 
But what about early vision? I find I prioritize vision more than my lane opponent almost every game (toplane mid gold mmr), and my top river bush is lit up from 2:30 (tp in) until the end of the laning phase with a combination of trinkets, green wards, pink wards, and then my t2 trinket after 9. Unless you're reducing the level req on trinket upgrades, this means I simply won't be able to maintain my perfect vision. That makes no sense, it's always been the case that if you want vision, you can get vision, it will just cost a little. Do I need to go sightstone Riven?
http://wardscore.loltools.net/?name=wizard%20hat&region=na >84% of players, and that was a month or so ago when I played mid, I've improved now that I've switched to top

[–]pedrobingonzales 0 points 14 days ago 
is that a an equality to supp players :D

[–]Selthor 1 point 14 days ago 
Pwyff said in this thread that the yellow one starts with 2 wards now.

[–]TBH_Coron 2 points 14 days ago 
does this mean bye-bye sightstone????

[–]Smatter 12 points 14 days ago 
No, it makes Sightstone more valuable. Plus there are going to be cost efficient Sightstone upgrades.

[–]iDannyELiShinobi 3 points 14 days ago 
More like hello.

[–]HookandLantern[lanternoflife] (NA) 3 points 14 days ago 
No sightstone is getting a 3rd tier upgrade that they didn't go into detail about.

[–]FoleyX90 1 point 14 days ago 
No. They're buffing sighstone.

[–]Alkalilee 811 points 14 days ago* 
Top lane gets stuff to do besides tp bot? Yay! \o/

[–]DXCharger 210 points 14 days ago 
They said they'd be looking into TP changes (but no guarantees) in the pre-season as well. Don't be surprised if TP top lane becomes a thing of the past once again.

[–]Alkalilee 157 points 14 days ago 
I'm honestly fine with tp being gone. The entire worlds meta right now is punishing poor positioning, and I think bot lane has to develop this constant spidey sense that says "shit if top tp's we're dead". Tp also ruins top lane snowballing pretty hard, and I think a more balanced substitute can be used (a single use homeguard type item that lets you get back to land without missing too much).

[–]Hi_Im_Saxby 96 points 14 days ago* 
It's not even as simple complicated as punishing poor positioning, it's basically "oh shit, we're past the halfway point in bot lane, better back off because we're going to get 5-man ganked. TP has actually ruined most of laning phase.

[–]_XanderD 8 points 13 days ago 
They can fix the problem by limiting the range of TP like most globals... I'm looking at you GP Ult. -___-

[–]Hi_Im_Saxby 6 points 13 days ago 
That isn't really the problem. The biggest problem is chopping a massive portion of the cooldown to get back to lane by TP'ing to a turret. It's basically "oh, I'm getting wildly outplayed in lane? No problem when I have TP every 4 minutes".

[–]FlintShaman[Rainorak] (NA) 4 points 13 days ago 
If you are getting squashed in lane tp won't save that turret. Any champ with decent turret pressure and wave clear will have it gone before cool down is over.

[–]Hi_Im_Saxby 6 points 13 days ago 
Not with the changes Riot made so nobody can do meaningful damage to turrets by themselves early. You can TP back to lane at least 2 or 3 times if you're getting stomped before the turret goes down.

[–]HolyBudfffffff 1 point 12 days ago 
Tier 1s still go down in about the same time but a toplaner can literally sit under tier 2's for all year if he wants.

[–]Hi_Im_Saxby 0 points 12 days ago 
They go down nowhere near as fast as they used to. Now before like 8 minutes or whatever you're lucky to get 30 damage per hit.

[–]DerpytheH 0 points 13 days ago 
Because that certainly wouldn't absolutely nerf it in late game at all.

[–]Swoleus 2 points 13 days ago 
Yeah this, current TP (especially double TP) just extends laning phase and creates a boring experience for anyone that plays bot lane.

[–]TDS_Gluttony 1 point 13 days ago 
Didn't you mean "as complicated as poor positioning"? Not even as simple implies that "poor positioning", which can be many different events, is more complicated than "past this line and your dead".
Please don't destroy me with downvotes. I'm just wondering. My grammar not so great

[–]Hi_Im_Saxby 0 points 13 days ago 
I believe you're right, and it makes sense, henceforth I've edited my response. Thanks.

[–]spirited1 1 point 13 days ago 
I main support and it's the worst. Especially when their jungler takes TP too...

[–]Hurenschande 1 point 13 days ago 
Why Do you even push? As adc/supp it's way better to freeze the lane near your tower than to overextend towards the enemy Power? Regardless of TP.

[–]Hi_Im_Saxby 0 points 13 days ago 
Because if I'm playing Graves Leona vs. Vayne Soraka I'm going to push the ever living fuck out of the lane and make Vayne miss cs under turret. Also, if the wave is frozen at your turret, it's literally holding up a sign that tells the enemy bottom lane to either roam, or 4 (even 5) man dive them under turret with teleport.

[–]Hurenschande 1 point 13 days ago 
But you're also holding up a bigger sign that tell your team to 4/5 man gank the enemy botlane. Also, you can't towerdive if you're not under teh tower, just near your tower.
Towards the last hitting. She will have a harder time lasthitting (as she has more minions doing damage) than you and has to massivly overextend. Also you can just zone her out of experience range.

[–]sarcasm_is_love 1 point 13 days ago 
This is the problem.
TP not only makes 1v1 aggression top/mid lane less rewarding, it actively discourages bot lane from playing aggressively as well.
Essentially whenever one or more TPs are off CD, every lane is held hostage with the threat of a TP gank.

[–]Hurenschande 1 point 13 days ago 
But encourages team play in a team game.

[–]sarcasm_is_love 1 point 12 days ago 
Basketball is a team game
Soccer is a team game
Football is a team game
None of these team games have a mechanic that discourages individual players from aggressive playmaking.

Or you can only tp to wards YOU placed, that would be fun.

[–]Alkalilee 1 point 13 days ago 
+1

[–]xxLetheanxx 1 point 13 days ago 
IDK. TP is pretty much necessary for some laners to even function. Being "forced" to take it on everyone is a problem. Instead of just removing TP they need to find a way to make it more of a niche pick. You take it if you are going to lose lane as a buffer if you get counter picked.

[–]blackout27 1 point 13 days ago

[–]Dx724 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm starting to think a "tagged"/"marked" teleportation spell would be nice. Similar to mark/dash in a way, you'd use it on the tower/ward beforehand then back. After that, you'd activate it to return (obviously, much longer cooldowns)
It'd keep you from losing much xp, but limiting ganks to places you've been recently, allowing bot lane to know when to be safer

[–]ManWithoutModem 1 point 13 days ago 
(a single use homeguard type item that lets you get back to land without missing too much).
doesn't dota 2 have upgradeable boots that lets you teleport? lol

[–]Alkalilee 1 point 13 days ago 
My idea gets rid of tp. Not even boots related. Like a single consumable that gives you movespeed out of base.

[–]ManWithoutModem 1 point 13 days ago 
so like a 1 time homeguard?

[–]Dmienduerst 82 points 14 days ago 
I don't think it will go away because they like the depth TP creates. They want to for sure get it out of mid lane and somehow limit the top lane version of it so that it super punishing if you fail it. Also people keep saying they need to remove the tp to lane element which I disagree with.

[–]Marsdreamer 68 points 14 days ago 
As long as they stop the impromptu 5v5 teamfights in botlane at 8 minutes, I'm good.

[–]Vayce 51 points 13 days ago 
more like 5v2, but ya

[–]xxLetheanxx 1 point 13 days ago 
I don't mind these so much. What really blows is when it is 2v5 because your team couldn't give a fuck.

[–]arkhammer 10 points 14 days ago 
It probably won't go away, but I think we'll definitely see some changes to how frequently/easy you can TP around. Double TP meta makes this support main sad.

[–]Nichi789 4 points 13 days ago 
I'd be fine with them putting a range cap on it. Kinda like how TF and Pan had their globals nerfed. That would keep the silliness in check, while still allowing the team fights if they are planned.

[–]PHUNkH0U53 1 point 13 days ago 
maybe have the range scale during gameplay until it's a global for end game play.

[–]The-ArtfulDodgerFrostbutt Darius 3 points 13 days ago 
It would be fine if they just increased the cooldown by about 50%. I guarantee people would still take it.

[–]Craigellachie 2 points 13 days ago 
If they like the depth they should just cut to the chase and make TP a purchasable one use item. Make it costly enough that going for that gank on bot has real consequences.

[–]Dmienduerst 2 points 13 days ago 
I like the idea of TP scrolls in league but then you go they don't want mid lane to have it since they want them to walk there and what is their 6 item TP strategy?
I don't think they actually mind the bot lane gank play parameter even if it really pisses of the duo lane players. I think the bigger problem is that it can both be used as a crutch top and a gank bot without losing anything. So the thought would be maybe weaken the lane your tping from so the enemy has a choice of stay top or follow. Also I though maybe making damage cancel TP and increasing the channel a possibility though that feels shitty when playing i'm sure.

[–]RiotJag 2 points 13 days ago 
We definitely don't want to kill TP, for the reasons mentioned. We do think it's a bit ubiquitous though so we're going to reduce how frequently it's the best summoner for any lane. Not going away though.

[–]MadMeow 2 points 13 days ago 
Make it go away from bot pre minute 10 at least.
Its super frustrating to play both with and against.

[–]RiotJag 1 point 13 days ago 
As an ADC main, trust me, I hear you. It feels a lot better in our playtests right now.

[–]MadMeow 1 point 13 days ago 
Glad to hear it and thanks for responding :)

[–]Mojimi[Mojimi] (BR) 1 point 13 days ago 
DEPTH?

[–]Dmienduerst 1 point 13 days ago 
Stop focusing on just early game and look at late game strategy and you see the depth it provides. It lets 1-3-1 1-4 without shen or TF recoveries from quick duels all happen in late game. You want s2 where teams bashed their heads against the base until Shen was able to either break the base or open enough of a fight in mid then remove TP.

[–]SuperCharlesXYZ 1 point 13 days ago 
I think a simple cooldown increase will be enough of a nerf

[–]crumpus 1 point 13 days ago 
I like TP all lanes. TP OP.

[–]Lylat97 1 point 13 days ago 
TP to lane is fine. Solo a camp > TP to lane with an advantage if your enemy doesn't do the same is not so fine, imo.

[–]Dmienduerst 1 point 13 days ago 
Normally its not to an advantage though its normally breaks even unless your Olaf and can blitz the camp.

[–]sarcasm_is_love 1 point 13 days ago 
Having a Doran's + 5 pots is a massive advantage over Doran's + 1 pot or cloth armor + 5 pots. Even if the one who didn't do the camp hits 2 by the time you TP to lane.

[–]Dmienduerst 1 point 13 days ago 
Yes sure I'll give you that but you also give up a certain amount of lane control. When Sion was a big thing idk how many times I do the pull trick that LCS players do to freeze the lane on my side and it didn't matter if you had 5 pots you had to eat them to farm vs me. Obviously I'm not challenger so my point has little merit at higher levels but it was real easy to abuse lvl 1 camp people with the stronger laners like renek.

[–]davidsumner84 1 point 13 days ago 
I disagree also.

[–]Draki1903 1 point 14 days ago 
TP creates depth as well as creates shallowness. Good bye forcing enemy out of lane to make him miss CS. Good bye botlane winning because of a stronger laning matchup and no surprise TP ganks.

[–]Dmienduerst 1 point 14 days ago 
I think the problem is people tunnel on the shallowness TP creates early (this I agree with) and forget the crazy amount of depth in strategy it has created in mid to late game. It needs fixing no argument there but I would be stunned if they kill it entirely as it does make late game more fun to watch.

[–]gotbeefpudding 2 points 14 days ago 
yeah there's nothing like watching a losing team TP into enemy base and base race FTW or an insane backdoor while an enemy team is doing baron

[–]Draki1903 1 point 14 days ago 
IMO teleport should be a boot enchant.

[–]Dmienduerst 1 point 14 days ago 
I think thats dangerous because then what do you give up for it? Even if its a massive cost like Boots of Travel are it pays for itself really quickly with the amount of objective damage you can do from one decisive TP play. This doesn't fix the mid lane problem either. I would be more apt to put it on an actual tier 2 boot item like Boots of Travel but then you get snowballers with ignite and TP which sounds like a nightmare in its own right.

[–]Draki1903 0 points 14 days ago 
If you rush Boots of TP, you are not rushing something like Tiamat in top.

[–]Dmienduerst 2 points 13 days ago 
Who said anything about rushing? As a second item or even third you can dominate the lane survive the ganks or just kill them then have ignite and TP pressure in a side lane while your opposition has limited items to contest and he has to be at dragon for the fight which you can TP to. Why would you ever not play a guy like Renek who scales ok and can crush a lane single handedly then have a high chance of also having a massive amount more of map pressure from TP boots that he can afford with his gold difference.

[–]NY_Lights 0 points 14 days ago 
Exactly. Honestly even early you should feel guilty about TPing to return to lane after you got your ass kicked and had to back. I could push and force you out of lane, back myself, walk to mid/bot help my team get dragon, then TP back up top to catch the wave while you couldn't do shit. But most don't ever look at it that way, they just think it's a free ride.

[–]Simetraa 1 point 13 days ago 
I could push and force you out of lane, back myself, walk to mid/bot help my team get dragon, then TP back up top to catch the wave while you couldn't do shit.
Holy shit, your enemy top lane must be retarded.

[–]NY_Lights 1 point 13 days ago 
This would be a dream opportunity actually I will admit. Most likely it would be me just TP'ing bot for a gank then dragon. But it could happen that I'm able to walk there, although I would sacrifice a lot of tower damage and a lot of the minion wave.
I don't know how the enemy top would be retarded though. This is what people complain about, TPing back into lane after losing a fight. Most top laners would just continue pushing the lane because thats all they could do at that point. They can't walk all the way down to respond after I show up. That would be retarded.

[–]Blobos 3 points 13 days ago 
All these people hating on TP have no clue. TP has been a massive part of MOBAs since DotA 1.
In DotA2 you can buy TP scrolls for 100g

[–]davidsumner84 1 point 13 days ago 
Agreed 100%

[–]AsceLoL 2 points 14 days ago 
If the Rift Herald buff is strong enough than we might see tp gone from top lane.

[–]Variecs 2 points 13 days ago 
Smaller changes like increased cooldown & longer channel time when teleporting on minions would problably make it less popular as it wouldn't feel as useful. Honestly i'd be for just removing TP on minions / wards and just have it for turrets for losing matchups so you can stay in the game.

[–]LoveJustHate 1 point 13 days ago 
Well the herald buff let's you push harder right? Maybe they are adding a cost to TP'ing where your lane opponent who didn't take TP can get the herald, and push down your towers when you try to make a play bot

[–]Yuvalyo 1 point 13 days ago 
im pretty sure it will, with an objective up top in the early game ignite becomes a really good skirmishing tool, maybe too good to give it up for tp. although we may see some renekton vs shens matchups for example where the renekton will still run tp because he can get away with it at the early lvl skirmish

[–]CaptainCrafty 1 point 13 days ago 
I think it'd be awesome if they made TP a situational thing, but that's definitely hard to do

[–]MandrakeRootes 1 point 13 days ago 
remove TP from earth pls. Tpscroll master race.

[–]Taskforcem85 1 point 13 days ago 
I'd be fine with TP being deleted. It'd allow Riot to mess around with MS options.

[–]OnyxMelon 1 point 13 days ago 
Going to be smite top now for soloing the herald.

[–]Bunnylove_ 1 point 13 days ago 
In S2 it wasn't completely gone.
It was occasionally used on certain champions
Soaz was one of the primary teleport users, but not in every game or any champion. He also used it to make plays around the map and not to get back to lane
It was balanced until Riot buffed the shit out of it and if they would just revert the changes I think we would still see it just not every game

[–]hyrulepirate -3 points 14 days ago* 
I don't remember a point in competitive LoL history when TP wasn't relevant.

[–]hyrulepirate 1 point 14 days ago 
I've been around since season 1, actually. Tho you can say that running ignite top was viable in the earlier seasons, I'm actually talking about how teams value teleport in the competitive scene.

[–]NAsucksEUrules 1 point 14 days ago 
most toplaners used to run ignite or other offensive spells in the toplane
only fnatic did this back when tp was considered "bad"

[–]naturesbfLoL 1 point 14 days ago 
Fnatic disagrees with you

Eh in solo queue Ignite is still really freakin strong.
Try playing a good duelist (ex: Riven), take Ignite, and watch the enemy top laner try to 1v1 you.

[–]Alkalilee 26 points 14 days ago 
I actually ran tp ignite malphite to get out of bronze. Your level 3 1v1 is really strong that way, and junglers suck too much to abuse the fact that you're immobile till 6.

[–]fox112 7 points 14 days ago 
Your level 3 1v1
HEAVILY match up dependent but I see where you're coming from.
I donno if I could give up Flash on Malphite, makes for some bonkers-level engages.

[–]IMadeThisforMineZ 10 points 14 days ago 
Yeah but at bronze noone properly follows upon a good engage so it's better to focus on things that only help you

[–]Alkalilee 1 point 14 days ago 
You wouldn't normally blind pick malphite anyway, unless you have mid that really benefits off of group knockups.

[–]StoneOcean 2 points 13 days ago 
The problem is they don't have to, and even if you get a kill TP will offset most of whatever advantage you get unless you can immediatly kill them again as they come back down, and if you die yourself due to a gank or a mistake then you're doubly fucked because you won't have the same safety net.

[–]lichtgestalten 1 point 13 days ago 
tp + ignite jarvan versus "non tanky" laners.... oh god, its awesome

I play udyr tp/ignite and just kill riven at level 1. They always try and jump on you, not sure why.

[–]HansPeter666 1 point 13 days ago 
Or you take TP and get to start your lane with 2 Spells, a Dorans blade and 5 potions to combat rivens only weakness: sustain.

And then your opponent comes to lane with xp advantage and 5 pots, just farms it out until the cd is back up and then tps back to lane while you miss more xp or tps bot and snowballs the map while you're stuck top.

I want it to be a significant enough objective that people consider switching their top and bot lanes, so that they have more control over one objective or another.

NO MORE MANA POTS, NO MORE BUYABLE WARDS. EVERYBODY PANIC.

[–]Pwyff 494 points 14 days ago* 
Xypherous is running point on this change, but he's also gone through all champions who rely on mana pots to be functional and has buffed either their base mana regen or their base mana pool. In the future we can also keep a firmer grasp on mana gating and/or champions whose costs are just too damn high.
[edit] I'm getting a lot of specific champion questions or things of the sort so I'm going to paste my answer from the dev corner:
"There's a lot of concern on specific champions that we won't get 'perfect' out the gate with preseason and, while I think that's a super valid concern, it's one we can't be shackled to for the time being. I suspect most champs will get proper compensation before they ship, but what a change like this does is allows us to see what champions were using mana pot spamming to cover up massive weaknesses versus those who were using them to snowball forward. If we don't get it right the first time, you can be sure we are aware of the space we're creating and can solve for it."

[–]LurkingStoic 379 points 14 days ago 
Is Pantheon one of those champions? Because honestly without mana pots lane Pantheon sounds like it's dead.

[–]TenspeedGames 3 points 13 days ago 
flask and 4 minute tp back to lane with tear isn't enough for you?

[–]SoulMasterKaze 1 point 13 days ago 
The main issue for me is that tear doesn't give combat stats, so you have to choose between a pickaxe or tear, neither of which are particularly good in isolation.
Yorick also has some relevance problems until he hits 2 items, and I feel like this will hurt his early game quite a bit. It'll be interesting to see how the changes work out globally though.

To me that just sounds you have really shitty mana management

[–]Cistoran 12 points 13 days ago 
Not really. The entire point of lane Pantheon is to be a bully early by harassing the opponent so much you either get a massive CS lead or kill them for over extending.

[–]420weedscopes 0 points 13 days ago 
its not pantheon rather spamtheon on ur q is how u should play him

[–]formgry 2 points 13 days ago 
Gonna be time to switch your main then I suppose.

So I should have to switch mains because Riot wants to make a radical change to the game but refuses to balance all the champions in relation to the change?

[–]formgry 0 points 13 days ago 
You can't yet know if they will balance stuff properly. But if you start losing alot with your main then you'd probably need to switch yes.

[–]Cistoran 4 points 13 days ago 
The question was asked if Pantheon was considered someone that relied on mana pots, so in the hypothetical situation where he wasn't, it would be considered not balancing the game properly.

Actually, I think panth will be getting a buff. They are removing mana pots but it sounds like refillable flasks are going to be a thing, and hopefully it will still give mana. Now that it looks like they are up-gradable, there is hope.
If he doesn't get that then yes, he is fucked.

Usually I get them if I want to spam early but since you can only have the dorans ring regen isn't great. These supplement that a bit.

as a Sona (supp) main i am worthless without mana pots. Trying to poke? Alright, but you'll get out of mana very fucking fast and if you ever dare to press your heal button then you become useless because that heal use so much mana.

Please please please mean that lux's e no longer costs 130(!!!) mana.

[–]Hextherapy 15 points 14 days ago 
Someone asked Lulu and Lux... and they responded with Lulu, yes. So I guess Lux just goes back into being bad.

[–]Firezone[Overlord Charlie] (EU-W) 20 points 13 days ago 
i mean lux is pretty fucking good and one of the higher winrate champs in mid, but shes just so unrewarding to play because of the ridiculous mana cost of her E which doesnt even waveclear unless youre insanely fed

[–]Abujaffer 20 points 13 days ago 
There's a reason why Riot forces her to E + auto to clear waves. If Lux could clear the backline with one E, she would be insanely strong. She could push you in and roam every wave, and she has one of the strongest roams in the game. Her ult is up ~ every 2 waves early (since she builds cdr), and with its range she can offer almost tf levels of roaming. People here seem to forget how strong Lux is just because she isn't meta in competitive, or how strong and was when she was meta.

[–]Hextherapy 23 points 13 days ago 
I'm fine with it not clearing waves, I'm not fine with the 130 mana cost. You're forced to use it to cs under tower since she's so easily pushed. Maybe reward her for using her passive? "Lux restores 5 mana when she procs her passive."

[–]thebeastisback2007 1 point 13 days ago 
I love Lux, she was my main in season 2/3. But theres pretty much no reason to play her, because of poor expensive waveclear, a passive you get punished like a motherfucker for using, and terrible movement speed.

[–]Cumminswii 2 points 13 days ago 
I mean, she's got a 54.52% win rate (champion.gg so Plat+) so obviously there is some reason to play her.

[–]CorneliusSavarin 4 points 13 days ago 
Meanwhile all i have to do is aim my laser to clear the entire wave.
I used to play Lux, like A LOT. But this is one of the biggest reasons why I don't. High CD and mana costs feels really unrewarding.

[+][deleted] 13 days ago (4 children)
[–]Hextherapy 2 points 13 days ago 
"Lux restores 5 mana when she pops her passive"

[–]Swoleus 5 points 13 days ago 
Lowest would be like 120 (only speculation :P)
She had a lot of string buffs and is currently a high win rate mid laner so if anything they will probably keep her the same/buff mana regen rate.

[–]Dr_BalancedFaith age 5 points 13 days ago 
I just gave up on using lux e.
The damage doesn't justify -130 mana in a 1v1 at midlane
MAYBE if you have to back just drop it.
Otherwise it puts you behind in lane

[–]yamchagoku 1 point 13 days ago 
Pls Rito.

[–]dellaint[dellaint] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Holy shit, I had no idea it cost that much. Fizz E costs the same but seems soooo much more impactful. That's kinda ridiculous.

[–]RoseofThorns 0 points 13 days ago 
I play a decent amount of Lux, and her E being 130 mana is completely fair. Same reason as Fizz's E being more than his ult; spamming that shit is not okay, and you need to actually be punished for failing it.

[–]GallantKaiLEVER NUCKY 52 points 14 days ago 
Please don't forget Yorick. I know you guys at Riot hate him, but some people actally enjoy his gameplay, and he's by default a mana intensive champion

[–]Rahbek23 14 points 13 days ago 
To be fair that's what keeps laning against him survivable.
Might change when he's reworked in like 2017 or whenever the actually make it work.

[–]Tyisisbest 2 points 13 days ago

[–]egotisticalnoob 1 point 13 days ago

[–]davidsumner84 1 point 13 days ago 
I love Yorick. He is so insanely good, and no one plays him. His JG clear is insane, and you can build him with a tear (which I ALWAYS do) and mana management is doable, although always an issue with him (and his only flaw really IMO).

[–]leesyndrome_Fallzoul -2 points 14 days ago 
Yorick wasnt one of them, and I'm happy he needs to stop spell spamming on lane

[–]Kylins 0 points 13 days ago 
Its not like they're not removing mana items. Just means you have to play smarter and farm better earlier to get your thoughts tear or chalice.

[–]The-ArtfulDodgerFrostbutt Darius 3 points 13 days ago 
Really mixed feelings about the mana pot change.
Certain champions with particular potent abilities are only really restricted by the mana gate on their abilities. Forcing them to invest into mana pots if they want to maintain aggression in lane seemed like a fair trade off.
If I understand correctly, with mana pots being removed these champions with receive a buff to their MP5 to compensate. I am all for this idea as certain champions would really need it. But if having this passive increase allows these champion to basically play the same without having to invest gold into mana pots it could be problematic.
It could also result in a staler, safer more passive laning phase when champions are restricted to their passive MP5. This I see as a problem as safe long range control mages are already dominant.
Also if MP5 is buffed, its a direct buff to mages vs resource-less champions as it lessens the effectiveness of the strategy of outlasting your opponent's mana pool.
Will Crystalline Flask be removed/changed? Don't want to see the current situation where a Kassadin (who is supposed to be weak early) is out sustaining most mids simply due to this item.

[–]BrotherIshmael 1 point 14 days ago 
No. I don't care what champ has a little difficulty with mana. Galio has the least enjoyable early game without mana pots. At level 3 by using all 3 of your spells you've effectively lost close to half of your mana right off the bat and that's without poke prior to the spell usage.

[–]morallygreypirate[technowitch] (NA) 0 points 13 days ago 
Honestly, I'm torn between Galio and Karthas for Who Has The Least Enjoyable Early Game when it comes to mana pots.
Karthas has a terrible early game if you play him right because his kit costs so much mana and his base pool is terrible in comparison. ;n;

[–]rekenner 2 points 13 days ago 
da fuq
Karthus has one of the best base mana pools in the game and has one of the better mana regen tools in the game.
... stop sucking at lasthits? If you have a dring, you literally gain

[–]morallygreypirate[technowitch] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Not from what I've been seeing. Karthas's early-game sucks because his mana gets eaten up so damn quickly even if you land your last hits.
It gets better eventually, but the early-game is terrible unless you have mana pots and a flask. :x

[–]rekenner 2 points 13 days ago 
His early game sucks because his damage is entirely based on delayed skillshots, which are actually fairly hard to hit, and only do notable damage if you hit your lane opponent only. His mana isn't really that bad.

[–]RossTheRed 1 point 13 days ago 
Galio was my first Mid. Ever since I learned him I just don't go OoM anymore. It was like playing on Hard Mode.
Karthus, just last hit, rush a tear, then spam. Spam two Q's in the morning. Spam two Q's in the night. Spam two Q's in the afternoon, then you'll be alright.

[–]morallygreypirate[technowitch] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Skittle spam is great once you have the mana for it. :(
Once the mana management's fine, tho, it's basically kills for days with his E, ult, and skittles.

[–]OverlordForte 1 point 14 days ago 
This might be a significant kick to the shins for quite a few mana heavy persons, though, even with +Regen/+Mana. We're talking 'loses lane viability period' and resorts to passive farming.
100-200~ mana on demand is a huge counter weight to lose, especially against perma-pushers, non-mana/energy users, or super mana efficient 1-ability-wonders.

[–]MemorykTSM 1 point 13 days ago 
RIP Pantheon and Kha'zix.

[–]v1ncy 1 point 13 days ago 
Just a point that I wanna highlight. This mean that manaless champions would have even more advantage than mana champions?
Because they can just spam skills and mana champions would have to manage even more trades because they can't refill mana anymore?
I'm just a little confused about that. Talking about mana regen, could we have a starting item that has mana regen for AP/AD champions?
Maybe casters a mana hunger champions won't be a thing anymore?
I'm just throwing a lot of questions, but I feel that it's going to hit the game and the meta pretty hard.

[–]Hawkson2020 1 point 13 days ago 
If you guys are actually fixing people with absurd mana costs (A certain ex-statue comes to mind) then removing mana potions is going to be a healthy change simply by putting those champions in a slightly better spot.

[–]Ceridran 1 point 13 days ago 
You can see it at the part where Tristana appears to outrange the turret. However, I recently learned that it may be one of the new items, known as the Firecracker. It's like a Stattik Shiv or Luden's Echo that instead grants the next basic attack increased range and makes it explode, or something like that. It's probably the range indicator for that. RIP my dreams of normal AA range indicators.

[–]DONT_SCARY 4 points 14 days ago 
I'm gonna guess there will now be an item that increases your AA range. They talked about itemizing based on what you wanted to do as a marksman, and a range increaser will have you focus on towet taking but it probably doesn't have the best stats compared to an item that focuses on dueling

[–]parkwayy[Parkwayy] (NA) 3 points 13 days ago 
Unless the alternatives are much much better, a higher range item seems almost perma-pick.

[–]DONT_SCARY 3 points 13 days ago 
I have a feeling they would be much more powerful. An item taking up a whole slot end game, on top of a defensive item, with sub par stats but a range increase would seem inherently balanced.
On second thought, a vayne with that shit would be very dumb. Maybe I'm very wrong

[–]A_Spider_Monkey 1 point 13 days ago 
I imagine it would only apply to non champion targets, or maybe only towers... That's the only way I see it making any sense.

[–]DONT_SCARY 1 point 13 days ago 
That'd be a good way to balance it

[–]shrubs311 1 point 13 days ago 
Don't be so sure. What if it only gave 25 range? It would be helpful on people that need to push towers, but Graves probably wouldn't give a shit, or Jinx since she'd still be in tower range. However, Trist and Cait would like it a lot more since they get synergy. Maybe the extra range is only against towers, so it wouldn't be good unless you were about to siege.

They're going to compensate the removal of mana pots with mana regen buffs to champions that are heavily dependent on mana sustain to survive lane phase. Plus they said they're adding potions that refill on fountain (similar to flask) to fulfill your sustain needs (which I'm guessing there's both a health and mana refill pot). So don't worry, your mana-dependent champions aren't getting forgotten :)

[–]xG3TxSHOTx 4 points 14 days ago 
I hope they stay in aram at least.

[–]The_Cynist 2 points 14 days ago 
Xypherous is running point on this change, but he's also gone through all champions who rely on mana pots to be functional and has buffed either their base mana regen or their base mana pool. In the future we can also keep a firmer grasp on mana gating and/or champions whose costs are just too damn high.

if they dont increase anivia's mana regen, im gonna be frustrated!

[–]shrubs311 1 point 13 days ago 
They said now that mana pots are gone, they can properly compensate champs-for example, if Anivia couldn't afford pots she'd fall behind but if she could she would snowball. Now they can just give her better mana regen or a better mana pool since they don't have to worry about if a champ will buy pots.

Lol, it says theyre gonna "...mana being balanced against individual champion kits) like when they said they were going to "buff" champions that relied on DGF and only ended up buffing ahri.

[–]D3monFight3 3 points 14 days ago 
Actually they removed that buff from Ahri. So basically they proved that DFG wasn't really a core item on any champion. They either already had more than enough burst, or Luden's is enough. While also being a much better item overall.

[–]Hawkson2020 2 points 13 days ago 
You seem to have forgotten Veigar... who does fine without DFG now.
Or Fizz... who they nerfed several times after that because he didn't need DFG
Or Ahri... who they nerfed again because she didn't need DFG
And while they didn't buff LeBlanc, I would say she does fine without DFG as well.
Need I go on?

[–]SweetDisaster_Dirty Kat main 1 point 14 days ago 
Forgot Veigar?

[–]SensualMuffins 0 points 13 days ago 
Ahri, Fizz, and LB each got compensation, what are you talking about?
Ahri got the bonus damage on her Charm.
Fizz got bonus damage to champs marked by shark.
LB got increased ultimate damage and mark proc damage.

[–]DotColonSlashSlash 6 points 14 days ago 
Now my support is forced to go health pots instead of ward+3 mana pots. :)

[–]velrak 2 points 13 days ago 
dont most supports go 4 health or 3/1 anyway? Its way better to trade AA and then heal up than using mana pots...

[–]Gr0ode[Migr] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
mostly 4 sometime 3/1 and on specific champs 2/2 is a must.

[–]DerpytheH 0 points 13 days ago

Biscuits were meant for us specifically in the beginning. Since they were introduced with support starters, I've gone 4 Biscuits for all supports except maybe Soraka.

[–]I_post_my_opinions[Seth2195] (NA) 2 points 13 days ago 
Should always go 1 mana pot on mage supports. The utility is much more useful than the extra 150 health, especially so on supports with heals.

Jungle starting item(s) and the jungle has been tuned to compensate for - not only the health potions - but also the loss of many defensive masteries.

[–]Gr0ode[Migr] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
what about supports? there are some really mana hungry supports who'll have a hard time without a mana pot

[–]rg44_at_the_office 1 point 13 days ago 
you say that like riot is completely oblivious to 20% of their players and won't be tweaking monster damage, the amount of hp from each potion, or possibly even making cheaper jungle start items. They're not idiots, they're not going to make that change without compensating in other areas.

[–]JustynNAJustyn [NA] 1 point 14 days ago 
To be completely fair, you can double jungle with any jungler and have full HP at level 3 using only 1 potion (don't even have to use a potion for junglers who already have decent clears).

[–]-MarshMallowWhy So Serious? 1 point 14 days ago 
They announced that they will make TP changes, dont expect your toplaner to doublejungle if he can't tp lol.

[–]oberbernou 2 points 13 days ago 
whats the joke here?

[–]Jew_Soap 7 points 13 days ago* 
TSM has announced changes to their roster where dyrus retired, lustboy and Santorin are also gone and turtle is trying out for the adc position again. The joke is Bjergson was the only one who the team prioritized and the rest of the team was often referred to as "wards" because they did not contribute anything other than their walking vision. So he is saying TSM knew about the ward changes(getting removed from the shop) so it would explain why lustboy, dyrus, Santorin, turtle are not on TSM anymore.
Tl;Dr: in this context wards refers to dyrus, Santorin, turtle, and lustboy. They were "wards" for bjergson. They will not be playing anymore which = no more wards

[–]oberbernou 2 points 13 days ago

what is a quinn?

[–]TheFatBlueWhale 5 points 14 days ago 
Here is the PBE thread for Quinn. Her Ulti will be a low cooldown mobility ulti and she can not attack during the duration.

[–]Histirea 2 points 13 days ago 
Correction: no cooldown mobility ult.

[–]VA1KYR13 2 points 13 days ago 
Well, here it's mentioned that it gives Quinn out of combat movement speed, meaning sure Quinn will "stay ranged", but the moment she attacks someone, Valor will stop flying her around. That's what I understood of it anyways.

[–]j3rmz 1 point 13 days ago 
This is correct. The ult still has the AoE effect on transformation like it does now, but if she attacks while "channeling", it will proc the AoE and cause her to go back to normal.

[–]ThymianFTW 1 point 14 days ago 
She's obv going to shoot a giant laser out of her mouth.

I feel like she'll be able to fly over terrain or something like that.

[–]ihadanaccountonce 1 point 13 days ago 
Then why would you ever not be in Ult mode? That seems mega-broken if I'm understanding you right... Then again, Riot's not scared of releasing mega-broken mechanics. cough Ghost Dragon cough

[–]Histirea 1 point 13 days ago 
It automatically cancels you out of your ultimate if you attack, be it with autoattacks, Aerial Assault (the new Blinding Assault, since it doesn't have a blind anymore) or Vault. They intended Quinn to have some pull in mid lane as a roaming marksman with her kit changes, according to their replies on the PBE boards.
However, you can still use Heightened Senses while "in flight" without cancelling her ultimate.

[–]Ithinkandstuff 1 point 13 days ago 
According to that thread, she loses the ability to auto attack or cast spells while in ult, and auto attacking will instantly cancel the ult.

[–]Cumminswii 1 point 13 days ago 
When she attacks the ulti stops. Shes basically a roaming ADC from what I can tell...

[–]IronStylus 6 points 13 days ago 
She's really fun! I'm in no way a good marksman player, I crave a lot of utility in the champions I main. As I played her in play test the utility THEIR ult offers gives me a real sense of freedom to get around, get away, reposition and generally take it to the dude who keeps trying to gank me.
Amusingly, this is the space we had thought Q&V would operate. We wanted Quinn to feel like a ranger who wasn't your standard arrow slinger, and Valor to feel like a legitimate partner. I was really pleased to see some of the things we had to discard way back in the day finally realized.
As you'll see when you get your hands on them is some really excellent work the Animation and VFX teams put into the interaction between Quinn and Valor in the lead up to the ult and the flight mode itself. Those guys do amazing work and it's incredible to see just how far a little polish can go, and how uniquely they go about solving the challenges they have in front of them!
Congrats all around to the whole team who worked really hard on the marksman updates!

[–]SVivum 2 points 13 days ago 
I remember last season there was something about her ult being 0 second cooldown and I guess that is this coming to fruition. I'm super excited by what I've read on the PBE forums so far.
As someone who plays mainly marksman and jungle a super roam-y marksman sounds right up my alley.

[–]intergalacticvoyage 1 point 13 days ago 
A 2 second channel time on her ult seems a bit excessive, do you feel that it plays well?

[–]Hyogetaki_Hisame 5 points 13 days ago 
I really don't like the changes tho, and the channel time on R will make it impossible to use mid fight to reposition. I really feel my beloved quinn and valor will be gone in preseason, forever lost

This suggests otherwise:

Looks like her ult will just be an unlimited solo sivir ult.

[–]Simetraa 1 point 13 days ago 
I didn't like the changes so far. Giving her blind to have a chance in trading because she is low ranged. Then taking the blind away while not touching the range. I hope this won't be as terrible as I think.
Another point is ulti. 2 second channel was necessary? And now it has even less damage. Why would you keep the damage at all if all I can do is scratch the enemy. I wish they removed that and gave a buff to somewhere else.

[–]lofidriveby 226 points 13 days ago 
RiotScruffy on the Marksman changes:
Caitlyn
The zone control marksmen (traps are on a charge system now)
New play feel with headshot combos (trap and E trigger a guaranteed headshot on the target)
Miss Fortune
The wombo combo marksmen (ult scaling way better, can crit)
New play feel with impure shots replaced with "love tap" new passive that gives bonus damage when swapping targets (this works well with Q)
Kog'Maw
The true glass cannon hyper carry (tons of dmg needs protection)
W now doubles ALL attack speed and allows him to break the attack speed cap (but ad is lowered to 60%)
Corki
Magic damage marksmen -> passive now does big magic damage instead of true and all spells now do magic damage
New mechanic: Special Delivery -> every ~5m in the game corki gets a special set of bombs in his base that allow him to cast a super mega W with much bigger range and impact
Quinn
The map mobility/roaming marksmen
R reworked as a utility focused spell -> 0 cooldown and gives quinn crazy out of combat speed to quickly move around the map, not used for assassination anymore
Graves
We finally made his shotgun a shotgun -> up close burst damage marksmen
Basic attacks fire multiple buckshots in a cone -> more damage up clost
Q reworked to synergize better with the new basic attacks

[–]Th35tr1k3r 3 points 13 days ago 
Well ap kog isn't about as and chucking with aas but rather long range ultimate and e/q poke. W is nice but the the gold for as is in my opinion better spent on ap

[–]FirCone 1 point 13 days ago 
I'd agree, but even his W scales with the AP he gets, and more AS means more of that damage as well.

[–]didattoo 1 point 13 days ago 
but you shouldn't be in auto range in optimal situations as ap kog since you most likely don't have a team centered around peeling you just because you have sub optimal auto damage.

The new Corki mechanic with his W sounds weird, because I can't picture bombs synergizing with his mobility spell. I'm sure Riot will do it well, and more importantly I can't wait to see the Dragonwing Corki particles.

[–]Rosario101 52 points 13 days ago* 
RiotScruffy also had this to say about the Corki W:
When he picks up "The package" he gets a homeguard like buff to help him find a fight/gank.
The "special delivery" (the mega W cast) is basically this:
3x range of normal Valkyrie. Has a knockaside when it hits enemies. Damage zone is way more dangerous + it has a slow. Normal W is put on 0 cooldown after he casts it (to let him reposition). So this ability is best used to separate a team fight or trap enemies in bad positions.

[–]murphymc 2 points 13 days ago 
Close but no cigar.

[–]dnl101 1 point 13 days ago 
They will never manage to balance this. He will either one shot everyone or be complete garbage.

[–]maximoothTSM Doublelift 2 points 13 days ago 
why

[–]dnl101 3 points 13 days ago* 
Because the ADC usually should stay as far back as possible because it a glasscannon build. Meaning you will die very fast if the bruiser get a hold of you.
Now couple this with an ADC that has to get into close range. For him to deal with the bruiser he either needs some insane close up damage or tankyness. That's what he needs for teamfights. However, this would be incredible OP in the laning phase. A tanky ADC that deals high damage in close range. Does mordekaiser ring a bell?
And considering riots history with reworks it easy to say that he will either be OP or useless, or most likely first OP than nerfed into bench.

[–]maximoothTSM Doublelift 1 point 13 days ago 
But that's what Graves has always been and exactly what he was when he was strongest. He liked being as close as possible to the enemy back line because he could burst them, but it was also insanely risky because he was a squishy ADC. He also sucked late because his whole niche was getting ahead enough early so that in mid game he could do enough damage to the back line to be worth it. With all the tanks and meta favoring late game ADCs, he naturally faded away.
This change will probably keep him in his current state of play, but if the meta shifts towards higher risk higher reward teams again, then he might be strong again.
HOWEVER -- they are also seriously changing ADC items and we don't know for sure how they will change Graves, so making the claim that Graves will stay in his cycle of OP then trash then OP again is a pretty big assumption.
I agree that he, just like any other ADC, could be super strong or super weak after these changes, but saying that "He will either one shot everyone or be complete garbage." is a huge assumption.

[–]dnl101 1 point 13 days ago 
I agree that he, just like any other ADC, could be super strong or super weak after these changes, but saying that "He will either one shot everyone or be complete garbage." is a huge assumption.
You said the same thing though:
his whole niche was getting ahead enough early so that in mid game he could do enough damage to the back line to be worth it. With all the tanks and meta favoring late game ADCs, he naturally faded away.
This boils down to what I said.
And don't use that phrase:
higher risk higher reward
It's just another buzzkill phrase from riot like "counterplay" or "strategic diversity". It gets thrown around every patch and what meta do we have? 15min fb and 4 kills and 20mins on average?

[–]maximoothTSM Doublelift 1 point 13 days ago 
Counterplay: Ability to outplay an opponent so that in a situation of equal power, the player who's better at the game will kill the other person
Strategic Diversity: Having multiple strategies and counterstrategies to win a game. Lack of strategic diversity: Only late game siege comps win, no other comps work. Good strategic diversity: Tons of champions can be used, early or late, and you can do hard engage comps, disengage comps, siege comps, and many more.
I also said that because of the huge changes in ADC items, there's no way to know for sure how it will effect Graves's balance since he's always been limited to the same old ADC items since his creation.

[–]dnl101 1 point 13 days ago 
Riots usage:
"We are changing ability X because there was no counterplay" regardless of whether this was the case or is the case after the change.
Same with strategic diversity. How often did I see "strategic diversity" in patchnotes. Did I ever see different strats or team comps? No.

[–]maximoothTSM Doublelift 1 point 13 days ago 
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. You're just generalizing without saying anything specific or giving any examples.
The League meta is the most diverse it has ever been ever. This Worlds has a higher number of champions picked than any other worlds by far. We see true tanks, bruisers, assassins, control mages, tank supports, utility supports, offensive junglers, control junglers, utility junglers - the meta is the most diverse it's ever been and every pro agrees.
I don't care if you don't see any strategic diversity or if you see any counterplay - pros and a majority of the League community sees them. The only recent blunder was Morde ADC, but no other champion has had any seriously complaints about them in professional LoL.

Corki Magic damage marksmen -> passive now does big magic damage instead of true and all spells now do magic damage
I hope this does not happen to Ezreal as well. Magic dmg Q would ruin my fav adc. :(

Health potions are going up in price...I sure hope there's some compensation for junglers or else everyone will have to go back after their 2nd or 3rd camp.

[–]RiotXypherous 56 points 13 days ago 
Starting item in the Jungle - as well as Jungle stats have been retuned.
That said, if you have to go back after your 3rd camp - there will also buy more items you can buy to help you out in the jungle - as there are more early items that are components for your tier 2 jungle item.

[–]The-ArtfulDodgerFrostbutt Darius 3 points 13 days ago 
Is forcing the early recall of junglers an intended objective? To reduce early jungle pressure etc.

[–]Audrion 1 point 13 days ago

[–]Xeredth 2 points 13 days ago 
That sounds good. Hoping to see the changes soon.

[–]ItzWarty 2 points 13 days ago 
Are tier-3 items staying the same? I really liked S3/S4's jungle itemization because stone enabled a more diverse pool of champions and playstyles. In contrast, this season's jungle felt pretty brutal.
Also, what are your thoughts on Devourer not counting pre-purchase stacks? As a Yi main (S4 D2) I feel this has led to really snowbally games where, at a worst case, you might have 17 stacks at 25 minutes. This worst case is so bad that some Yi players (e.g. silencee) opt to build straight IE.

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
The Tier 3's are, as of yet, not being changed. I know they've been scrutinized by a variety of sources - but I don't know of any immediate plans to change them.
As far as Devourer and pre-purchase stacks - I don't really have any coherent thoughts around it. I don't have a great model of the transition phase of the jungle personally and so I can't see a definite reason why one is better than the other. I'd have to poke around.

[–]LoZfan03 2 points 13 days ago 
I can't count the number of times where I've wanted to postpone an early dragon because I have the money to finish devourer and there's no faster way to stack. If it counted pre-purchase stacks, that would simplify that situation greatly. That may unequally buffs players that are already in a winning situation, but on the other hand, it might be nice for losing players to have a clearer sense of when to pivot to a different build if early game isn't panning out. It would also put pressure on the enemy jungler to counterjungle and control dragon and crabs from the beginning of the game rather than being able to kick back until it's completed. Overall, it might (lots of hand-wavey maybes here) make the item more consistent and predictable. But it'd also be way way worse if you build it anyway when you shouldn't. Don't know if that helps, but just some thoughts!

[–]Histirea 2 points 13 days ago 
Perhaps it should only count stacks acquired from dragons (and possibly the Rift Herald) pre-Devourer. That way, if you already have dragon control, you're rewarded for getting it as early as possible. All Devourer junglers can reliably solo dragon even before finishing Devourer, but they almost always delay that first dragon because the stacks are 100% required to Sate within 17 minutes for a reasonable midgame power spike.
At the same time, by not counting regular camps it disincentivizes passive powerfarming from champions like Warwick.

[–]J0rdian[Jordian] (NA) 0 points 13 days ago 
Can you please re look at Runeglaive? Since it has been introduced it has not really helped any junglers, but crippled a few. Sheen is an item only a select few champions can use well and if you can't well you got fucked by the change.

[–]shrubs311 0 points 13 days ago 
The best way I think Runeglaive could be changed is buffing the mana regen-maybe to like 12%? It would allow ap junglers to jungle easier.

[–]J0rdian[Jordian] (NA) 0 points 13 days ago 
that doesn't fix the problem that got introduced when runeglaive was added. All that would do is buff the item as a whole which is a bad idea since there is no need to buff other junglers.

[–]shrubs311 1 point 13 days ago 
What's the issue then? It still gives good stats for ap junglers. The only way to make it as good as magus is to buff the stats, but then the passive effect would have to be nerfed.

[–]J0rdian[Jordian] (NA) 2 points 13 days ago 
I already said the problem in my original post...

[–]DigitalRazor[digitalrazor] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Something something bring back spirit stone. and heart of gold whilst you're at it.

Linking mana regeneration to DPS is something that I don't think I'd charitably bring back in that explicit of a fashion. :p

[–]DreamyMeadow 1 point 13 days ago 
I don't doubt that you've got all ends covered but please do not forget about supports that try to spam that offensive Q (Thresh, Morgana, Blitz....) or any other ability and love to stock on blue pots early. Hoping this change won't mean a stall laning phase for guys like Blitz because that, in my eyes, is the end for such supports.

I would love and hate a champion like him in League.
Love because it's a amazing kit and hate because people here are just too dumb to understand how he works since all the champions have such a generic kit in comparison with HoTS

[–]Diabols 3 points 13 days ago 
Isn't it kind of the point of these changes, to make more unique kits?

[–]Maider23Faith is with us now. 4 points 13 days ago 
well, if you never saw the champions in HoTS they kinda go far away from the meta a lot of time, like champion that is actually 3 and one who uses it's team mates to control the battle, while in league it's always "do damage", "take damage" , "suports" . This is not unique, they are just different from each other but still fitting into the same confort zone that league created,there may be now the time to leave this confort zone since they see its boring to play adc and like,half of them do the same thing with not much difference.

[–]GreedDisaster 2 points 13 days ago* 
Well, HoTS also has completely different map objectives and artificially overcomplicated champs seem to lack proper balance.
Personally I'd call most of the features in HoTS gimmicky bullshit. Nothing that is interesting on a long-term basis. Despite your claims, League keeps maintaining a gigantic fanbase and still grows with every year. This game didn't get boring, it changed significantly over the years and people went with it, enjoyed it.
You see, in the end you don't need a bunch of hastily created "unique" champs for a game to be played at a competitively high level. Think of chess, both sides entirely homogenous when it comes to the abilities of the figures. Still a complex game.

[–]Mariana905 2 points 13 days ago 
Other than Shaco he's been my main since beta... so yeah not me lol. No but seriously I love Karthus so much. People just don't play him correctly imo. You should be aggressive and just because your ult is global doesn't mean you shouldn't roam for an easy kill. Plus he's easy to climb with because lower ELO people do not itemize optimally for every situation and he is a lategame powerhouse, games always go late there. Higher ELO he is just boring to play with or against, so I guess nobody likes him. But hey, at least you're not laning as or against a Nasus. :D Ever since Azir came out I've thought of him as a better, more mobile Karthus, and I know that is weird to say, but they do all the same things to an extent.

It's fun to think reminisce about season 2 but if you actually went back and played it it'd be awful. Junglers job was to buy oracles ASAP then clear wards all game, everyone buys HoG/Philo/Kage's and as a result the games drag on forever. And ADC mains played Corki, Ezreal or Graves or fucked off.

[–]Jalleia 3 points 13 days ago 
That's not entirely true. While the oracle is true for the pro scene, even at higher elos oracle wasn't always bought that early. Also S2 started using carries like Ezreal and Corki towards the end of it, not at the beginning, and even then people still played Vayne and Kog consistently, unlike now.

Something like during the Cataclysm when it was revamped and better stuff found on the bottom of the tree.

[–]Deathmarked -4 points 13 days ago 
Except Cataclysm was actually good. More like MoP that's gonna butcher League and people are gonna stop playing due to bullshit changes (too early to judge, but still the direction they're trying to take is dumb).

[–]velrak 3 points 13 days ago 
MoP was pretty good just kinda lacked content in the end. Also i like the changes, makes the game feel more diverse.

[–]notsobigboss 1 point 13 days ago 
It honestly feels like they're dumbing the core of the game down. From the mastery changes it appears that you get more raw stats from them. The wards, too. Free wards for everyone! Now you don't have to use your brain about warding because they're totally free.
That said though, these are just the early list of changes and I guess we'll have to wait and see how it pans out.

[–]velrak 1 point 13 days ago 
Well its not like most people bought any green wards anyway. Maybe the jungler, but they can have sighstone. Support has stone. Adc dont buy wards. Top & mid maybe before lv9. I dont think much will change with the ward changes, the most bought ward were usually pinks.

[–]Deathmarked -1 points 13 days ago 
makes the game feel more diverse.
People like you with completely flawed opinions and standards on the whole "changes/diversity" subject is the reason Riot is destroying their game. But well the majority of the playerbase is casual so it does make sense.

[–]velrak 1 point 13 days ago 
so why is your opinion "superior"? Spoiler: It isnt.

[–]Deathmarked 0 points 13 days ago 
Apart from the fact that I'm higher rated than 99.5 % of the playerbase, I've played far more competitve games than your average League player to know that this "diversity and we wanna give champions an "identity" like they are fucking anime characters" is nonsense and doesn't reflect how good the game actually is. Also for your "spoiler" joke, you should stop trying to act smart, because that's not how you do it.

[–]Golden_NozdormuWTB Friends 1 point 13 days ago 
I feel like it might possibly be a good idea, maybe, to wait until the changes roll out before you decide they ruined the game.

[–]Diostukos(NA) 349 points 14 days ago* 
Ok, removing mana pots is.....interesting, to say the least.
Hopefully they're be looking at mana costs with AP Supports. I can't see myself lasting long in lane as Sona, Nami, Karma, or Lulu.
Edit: I forgot to include Zyra as well, her mana costs early on are crippling, will be even more so now without mana pots.

[–]Ilyak1986 169 points 14 days ago 
Yeah, they'll have to give Sona compensatory buffs.

[–]Distasteful_Username 1 point 13 days ago 
you technically shouldn't be using mana pots on any of those.. or nearly any support for that matter. you can argue that on alistar it's useful though, because he gets more health per potion if he spams E and then regains mana, instead of only using a potion. although if you just look at probuilds, pros only really use health pots, maybe 1-2 mana on alistar though.

[–]Whats_Up4444 1 point 13 days ago

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
Sona, Nami, Karma, or Lulu. (Zyra)
If the data said they bought 2 or more potions, they probably got a bump to base mana regeneration.
Additionally, with AP supports - Frostfang has significantly more mana regeneration on it - as the item was a bit weak.

[–]Diostukos(NA) 2 points 13 days ago

[–]Gr0ode[Migr] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
what about blitzcrank/thresh/braum? I always go one mana pot on them and I think it's necessary if you want to make aggressive plays on those champs and not just derp in lane.

[–]Syreniac 5 points 14 days ago 
This is going to be an indirect buff to manaless champions vs mana champions, which has a history of being a pain point for Riot.

[–]Ixionas 5 points 13 days ago 
Or end up being a buff to mana champions when they adjust mana regen for the dependant champs so they no longer have to invest in mana pots

[–]the_ravenous_red 2 points 13 days ago 
I don't really see a problem with this. Resource-less champions already have enough of an advantage as is.

[–]Smart_in_his_face 2 points 14 days ago 
Affects midlane mages as well. I like going Ludens first on Ahri, double dorans ring and a few mana pots gives the sustain you need in lane.
Or the powerpush on Sivir botlane. Getting a few mana pots allows you to clear waves crazy fast without going oom.
Or tanky junglers like Gragas or Cinderhulk Ekko, who clears slowly and sometimes need a few mana pots early to speed up camps.
Removing mana pots is a big deal.

[–]Diostukos(NA) 3 points 14 days ago 
Yeah, that's my Ahri build as well.
Maybe they'll make blue buff last longer? Haha

[–]HeyLuke 2 points 13 days ago 
Agreed, I usually get 3 mana pots and 1 hp pot as Nami, since I can convert all that mana into hp (and hopefully gold aswell) anyway.

[–]Diostukos(NA) 2 points 13 days ago 
Yeah, that's what I do as well. I think it works best on Nami because her heal is pretty mana efficient if you can also land the double heal or double poke.

[–]narpilepsy 2 points 13 days ago 
Also Morgana and Blitz early game relies so much on those mana pots. Not sure where they're getting the logic to just completely remove certain very useful items without a second thought.

[–]Diostukos(NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
A Rioter stated they'll be looking at champions to see which ones were using mana pots to cover any heavy mana problems, so hopefully they'll keep their word when our Energy and Resourcless overlords take over haha

[–]Chiiwa 2 points 13 days ago 
I never even bought mana pots. Biscuits usually lasted me entire laning phase.

[–]Peraz 1 point 13 days ago 
Calling it right now, Energy and resourceless mid laners are going to be even stronger.

[–]Mrhiddenlotus 1 point 13 days ago 
Yeah I just don't get it. It's not necessarily that a lot of champs have mana problems, and that's why they need pots, but more because you should be able to choose your playstyle. If I want to poke them more and use more spells, I am going to want mana pots. Now that theyre going to be gone, then what? Just farm?

[–]OrderlyAnarchist 53 points 14 days ago 
To just comment on the whole vision thing before everybody panics TOO much, it looks like sightstone has upgrade paths in conjuction with the gold items, and it also mentioned free trinket upgrades .
They mentioned more options for those about to ward up, so they've probably got you covered still if you're a ward-conscientious solo laner.
I'm excited about "slot-efficient sightstone upgrades to", because this could make sightstone jungling much stronger in solo queue which would in turn make me very happy.

[–]HeyLuke 11 points 14 days ago 
I doubt they'd make sightstone much more stronger than it is now, since it's already a decent buy for most junglers. If they increase its buy path too much, top and mid lane might end up buying it as well, leaving the whole map littered with wards.
We can all be SKT now!

[–]Raion_sao 2 points 14 days ago 
It's not going to be a good day if 3+ roles are required to buy a ss I think.

[–]ultimomos[🍰] 2 points 14 days ago

Im super excited to combine SS with my targons/ ancient coin/ kage's. After boots, SS, and gold item, supports only really have 3 item slots. This could mean we actually get a chance to deal damage or something late game! :)

[–]ultimomos[🍰] 1 point 13 days ago 
See that would be really awesome. I'm loving how riot is diversifying the way champs play within their specific roles. I can't wait to see what they do with adc builds 😀

[–]narpilepsy 1 point 14 days ago 
So, is it only going to be the green sight wards that are getting removed, or is yellow trinket going too? (your comment leads me to believe that sightstone is staying)
My main issue is that a lot of the times, even as ADC or midlane, I'll buy a sight ward or two to help in the early game with vision and so I can know where the jungler is or if I'm getting ganked. It's just a good practice to buy a couple wards every now and then and a lot of people kind of overlook it as it is.
I don't get why they would remove an item that is so vital to vision and map awareness when they've said numerous times that their goal is to encourage players to ward and get map control.

[–]AnAngryFetus 1 point 13 days ago 
I mean, I'm still not going to see any change in plat and below because solo laners never fucking ward right now anyway. Just worried for Team Solo Mid. Now the other 4 really will be wards.

[–]superguardian 1 point 14 days ago 
There's also a reference to a blue trinket ward. I assume this isn't the same as the current blue trinket. Wonder what it is - maybe the mandrake ward that kept showing up on the PBE is ready for prime time?

[–]arkhammer 1 point 14 days ago 
Pwyff commented that the current iteration of the blue trinket places those 1hp wards with huge range, and they aren't limited by the ward cap. Should be a pretty interesting upgrade alternative over the yellow trinket. Hopefully this version of the blue trinket will help, um, marksmen to see "hidden" champs in the river bush to mid lane.

[–]coldize 1 point 14 days ago 
Upgraded blue trinket leaves a temporary ward in its target location. It seemed fairly obvious to me that this is what they were referencing.

[–]dkah41 0 points 13 days ago 
Ugh, flashbacks to launch Twitch. Nothing more annoying than seeing him pop out of stealth at your T3 turret across the map and kill it taking no damage in the process (his ult used to extend his AA range beyond turret range).

[–]Random_Nom 18 points 13 days ago 
And it still does.

[–]Lucifer_Hirsch 1 point 13 days ago

Preseason 2016 crests the horizon!
BY PWYFF
Welcome to Preseason 2016. We’re trying to keep the conversation low-key for now with the Worlds final right around the corner but, with a pile of changes hitting the PBE soon, we wanted to get ahead with our gameplay goals for this preseason. After Worlds, you’ll hear more from other teams at Riot - with more than just gameplay! - but we’ll keep this focused on what changes will be hitting the PBE for this preseason and the upcoming 2016 season.
Let’s talk seasonal goals!
You may have already seen our early work with the ability power itemization changes in patch 5.13 to the juggernaut update in 5.16, but our goal for 2016 is to make each game of League of Legends feel unique. From the different champion strengths you bring, to the items you take to battle, all the way to the masteries you choose - we want your decisions to matter and have a clear impact on how each game plays out.
That said, this preseason we’re focusing on...
Updating Marksmen
Through the years, marksmen have lacked meaningful differences, with their identities typically centered on the same thing: do lots of damage from range. In cases like these, if you’re being judged on only one competition (damage), you get a pretty obvious power ranking with no real roster depth.
Our goal is similar to our work with juggernauts, where we targeted a group of champions (in this case six marksmen - Corki, Miss Fortune, Graves, Caitlyn, Kog’Maw, and Quinn) who occupied similar strategic spaces, and gave them a little more ‘uniqueness.’ We’re doing this in two ways: how the marksman plays, and how the team plays with them. For the first, since marksmen are so concerned with their basic attacks we want to make sure each feels different. Should you have brought that shotgun to a javelin battle? Maybe! For the second approach, we want to really push the breadth of what a marksman offers. Much like how you pick Ashe for global stuns, or Sivir for when you gotta go fast, or Miss Fortune when you need some wombo for your combo, we want teams to think different based on who’s joining the fray.
Marksmen Itemization
Hand-in-hand with the updates for marksmen, we’re bringing some deep changes to marksmen items like we did with ability power purchases and juggernaut gear.
When we first tackled AP items, we wanted to accommodate the mages who blow up squishies while also offering equal opportunities for those who control the battlefield. When it comes to attack damage items, however, marksmen will always be focused on what lets them deal the most damage at any given point in time. Knowing this, we're offering more options when it comes to who (or what) you want to fight, and how you contribute to your team through that choice. So whether you want to be a lone gunman, dueling on the edge of the fight, or the nimble spellcaster, or the siege machine and tower crusher, we’re providing you with the right items to buy so you can take out the right targets.
Keystone Masteries
We’re updating the mastery system to offer focused, high-impact choices rather than a slew of nuanced micro-math optimizations. Each mastery tree will have three tiers. Each successive tier you invest in, you’ll be able to pick up some stats and a choice of one of three potential masteries (you can only choose one!). Tier 1 masteries will be nice to have (but not game-changing), tier 2s will have a decent amount of strength, but tier 3s - we’re calling them “Keystone masteries” - will be the ones that really augment your playstyle. We’re still experimenting in this space, but an example would be a keystone mastery that lets your damaging abilities also bleed enemy champions for a portion of your bonus AD and AP over time. Or one that grants a movement speed boost the moment you deal a large chunk of damage to an enemy champion.
By condensing power into clear decision points, the masteries you take from game to game should have an impact on your playstyle, and we want to offer multiple mastery paths for most champions in League.
Vision & Support Items
Two seasons ago we did a major revamp of the vision system by introducing sightstones, trinkets, and ward limits. This season, we’re adding more options for those about to ward up (also: we salute you). Our goal with vision is two-fold: first, we want to keep pushing the vision game as a team effort and, second, we want to make vision more dynamic than days past.
For that first goal, we’re doing things like free trinket upgrades for all, along with the option for tier 2 support items to upgrade into either powerful tier 3 active items or slot-efficient sightstone upgrades.
For the second goal, we’re removing Stealth Wards from the shop so teams will need to rely more heavily on their pink (and blue trinket!) wards to get the vision control they need. In tandem with this change, however, we’re also adding a new feature in ward ‘debris’ when a ward passes on. By giving you the ability to see the dead bodies of wards who’ve moved on with their lives, you’ll be able to learn more about your opponent’s vision habits as well as your own.
Starting Items
In-hand with our goal to offer a diverse preseason, we decided to take a gander at starting items. When there are standard starting item builds for every game of League, the end result is these builds tend to benefit (very slightly) certain champions over others. We’re taking a different approach this preseason by offering more clear opening ‘paths’ so that players can refine their playstyles with real choices, rather than just opting for a generally powerful start. You’ll see these changes reflected in two sets of items: starting power items, and sustain. For items you’re bringing to lane, we’re using the Doran’s set (blade, ring, and shield) as a baseline “generalist” group that provide all the broad stats you want. From there, we expanded your options to provide a few more ‘specialized’ approaches, like Cull - a light skirmishing AD starting item that provides less defensive stats than Doran’s Blade, but gives bonus gold for killing a set number of minions.
As for sustain items: we first started with health and mana potions. Health pots are going up in price to better position them as a purchase for those who just need some sustain to get them past the early game. Any form of long-term sustain we folded into the refillable potions (and their subsequent upgrades) to really solidify their identity (because before, it was… flask and potions to be a ‘sustain’ build). Mana potions, on the other hand, are being removed. Our decision to remove mana pots goes along the same philosophy as starting items. 100 mana tends to benefit certain types of champions over others (with mana costs being balanced against individual champion kits) and can wildly shift from being a mediocre purchase to a very cost-efficient one. By removing mana pots, we can better balance champion ability costs with the mana regeneration stat while also streamlining the ‘sustain game’ of League.
The Rift Herald
It’s no secret that players who depart for the top lane can end up feeling isolated without a dragon to contest. Rather than just flipping the map on its head, we’re exploring ways to bring some relevancy to the north so top laners can feel like they're interacting with their team before the 15 minute mark.
Details are still being sussed out, but expect to meet something new on Summoner’s Rift in the early phases of the game. Defeat it, and gain single target buff focused on early game power and pushing down the lane.
Wrapping Up...
We’ve got a few more changes on the way, but the above are some of our big gameplay plans for this preseason! That said, we’re not going to stop the conversation here. We’ll keep you updated on our progress while also sharing more of our long-term vision, so stay tuned after the World Finals for more on the preseason and 2016 season!

As a master rank 1 player on all servers I can safely say that my yellow trinket having 2 wards right off the bat pretty much makes this game skilless. I'd recommend everyone quit and go play Bloodline Champions.

[–]Hashmir 5 points 13 days ago 
As someone who has not read the actual post but has vaguely skimmed a couple of the reddit comments, I can say with absolute certainty that this will be the change that finally kills LoL. Once again Riot is selling out the playerbase for the sake of the pro scene and also this is a cash grab somehow.

super OP. spellvamp applies on his heal, so when he heals he heals, when he causes damage he heals, when he stuns he heals. his naturally tanky, so no need to build tank. with his low cooldowns, and passive, he can become melee vlad with a stun. check my OP.GG, I got diamond 3 maining it, if you want I'll do an ama.

that´s only true for one half of the sub though. I think marksmen do their job, but the roll just isnt fun to play anymore. I never had as little fun as i have now. And adc was my preferd position when i started to play until recently.

[–]JinxsLover -1 points 13 days ago 
well do you play adc? you are weaker then your support for about half the game and wayyyy weaker then mid or top

[–]Consideredresponse 4 points 13 days ago 
To be fair, being weaker than the support early is intended. They have the biggest impact early then fall off super hard, right about the time ADC's are getting their first big powerspikes.

[–]JinxsLover 1 point 13 days ago 
unless you are kench :D then you just outdamage your adc most of the game lol

[–]Gr0ode[Migr] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
so true i can even out damage a mid/top if i have a good game.

[–]JinxsLover 1 point 13 days ago 
mhmm been seeing more of him jg and top lately as well but been getting tired of him so ive just started banning him out hopefully the nerfs to other champs will free up some bans

Depending on how the new trinket updates will work, junglers are probably going to be stuck with sightstone in their build path for a very long time.

Working on a compilation post starting below.
Changes hitting either today(10/28) or tomorrow(10/29) hopefully.
Marksmen Changes

From the lol message boards. All brackets like these [ ] are things that I added to the post that reds mentioned later on.
Caitlyn
The zone control marksmen (traps are on a charge system now)
New play feel with headshot combos (trap and E trigger a guaranteed headshot on the target)
Miss Fortune
Miss Fortune is making her return as the queen of the Wombo Combo
Bullet Time now channels for a higher max duration and thus higher max damage output (DPS is similar if not better in most cases)
Bullet Time now scales much better into the later parts of the game - Miss Fortune now fires waves more rapidly at higher ranks and Bullet Time waves can now critically strike (but at a reduced amount)
Impure Shots is gone and has been replaced by Love Tap
Love Tap is now MF's character passive - it's a new basic attack mechanic that deals bonus damage whenever Miss Fortune attacks a new target
MF now gets a lot more value if she can manage to bounce her attacks between 2 or several targets
Strut has been moved to W's Passive now that Love Tap is her character passive
Kog'Maw
Bio-Arcane Barrage (W) has been changed to make Kog'Maw some kind of vomit-spewing machine gun while it is active.
While W is active, Kog'Maw attacks twice as fast, and his Attack Speed cap is doubled to 5 attacks per second.
While W is active, basic attacks deal reduced physical damage, but apply on-hit effects at full effect.
During this time, Kog'Maw attacks so fast that attack-moving efficiently becomes incredibly difficult, so choose a time when you don't need to move much, and go to town.
Living Artillery (R) has been repurposed to be less powerful in the average poke case, but very threatening as an execution tool.
Living Artillery's base damage and ratios have been adjusted, and it no longer deals increased base damage to champions.
Living Artillery now deals double damage to enemies at 25%-50% current Health, and triple damage to enemies below 25% Health
Various other changes/thoughts:
Base Attack Speed stats and Q's passive Attack Speed have been adjusted so he is more dependent upon maxing both his Q and W to really approach his full damage potential.
For those wondering, AP Kog'Maw will play a bit differently than before, but we believe it to be of about equal power to before.
Corki
Passive now does big magic damage instead of true and all spells now do magic damage
New Special Delivery -> every ~5m in the game corki gets a special set of bombs in his base[the fountain] that allow him to cast a super mega W.
3x range of normal Valkyrie
Has a knockaside when it hits enemies
Damage zone is way more dangerous + it has a slow
Normal W is put on 0 cooldown after he casts it (to let him re-position)
Quinn
Tag Team (R) has been heavily repurposed into a strategic map mobility tool:
Tag Team's visuals have been changed from Quinn leaving the game space to Valor flying Quinn around beneath her.
Tag Team now has a 2-second channel at its start, and no longer has combat spells or basic attacks.
Tag Team now has no cooldown, and its Movement Speed bonus is now very dramatic.
Skystrike has been retained, but deals less damage and does not deal increased damage based on targets' missing Health.
Blinding Assault (Q) has been repurposed (and renamed) into more of a waveclearing tool and less of a dueling tool:
Q's name has been changed to Aerial Assault, because... the spell no longer blinds.
Aerial Assault now marks its primary target as Vulnerable (passive mark).
Aerial Assault now does up to double damage based on targets' missing Health.
Half of Aerial Assault's cooldown is refunded if it kills at least one enemy.
Other
Harrier (P) attacks now deal a percentage of Quinn's total AD rather than a base and bonus AD ratio.
Vault (E) has had its dash speed increased, and it should now more reliably return you along the vector you dashed in on.
Graves
We finally made his shotgun a shotgun -> up close burst damage marksmen
Basic attacks fire multiple buckshots in a cone -> more damage up close. [It is possible to position so that you don't actually push if you want to freeze]
Q reworked to synergize better with the new basic attacks
Lucian
Amount of bullets fired will scale up with ult rank now instead of attack speed.
Should be the benefactor of new items thus passively getting buffed.
Marksmen Item Changes

These are some of the item changes for marksmen.
Infinity Edge is slightly weaker now (little less AD), we shifted power elsewhere so it's less automatic and so that we could add cooler things to the Marksman space.
Essence Reaver scales its CDR off of your critical strike chance so that it works as a big core item (think IE space). It can now give upwards of +30% CDR.
Phantom Dancer does stuff other than just be straight up damage. Bonus movement speed while near your opponents and you take last damage from the last champion you hit. Isolate and kill people, basically.
Rapid Firecannon charges up like Shiv, but when charged instead of prepping you for the thunder, increases your attack range and gives you a fiery hit at the end that is single target. Works on all champions, but it's a percentage increase (to a cap 150)
Shiv does even more damage versus minions. It's specialized further into being the bursty clearing tool.
Hurricane now crits and the bolts crit. Also movement speed. It's in the PD / Shiv space now, so it should be an option for more Marksman.
Executioner's Calling is back, but it's a bit different and cheaper. Also it's a component item. It builds into something new.
Last Whisper is now a component item. It builds into new things.
There's something called Giant Slayer. It hurts health dudes.
Merc scimitar has Lifesteal, you should feel comfortable taking it over BT.
Death's Dance A new item that has physical vamp. Also it "delays" damage.
And tons of changes all over the place. This is just some of the marks targeted ones.
Sight Changes

Just a few changes to go over thus far.
Stealth(aka green or sight) wards are gone and are not being directly replaced.
Sightstone remains in the game and is going to have more upgrade paths.
Junglers are going to have ways to opt into the vision game.
Trinkets automatically upgrade without cost
Yellow trinkets start with two charges
Pink wards play a larger role in vision and now cost 75g
PLACEHOLDER
Sightstone Changes
Sightstone has two upgrade paths:
You can take the default upgrade to Ruby Sightstone which grants you 10% Active Item CDR.
You can combine your base sightstone with your tier 2 support item.[ However if you choose this route you cannot buy Talisman of Ascension, Frost Queen's Claim or Face of the Mountain]
So you get two options here:
Buy the 'Combined' Sightstone and save an inventory slot for powerful passive items or defense items.
Buy Ruby Sightstone and the Tier 3 support active - and get reduced item cdr on the tier 3 support active and any future actives you might buy.
Mastery Changes

New Powerful masteries called keystone masteries that you can pick only one of.
The active item CDR mastery is pretty much gone with the new mastery system
Usability improvements(thank Zeus)
Mastery - Keystone
Thunderlord's Decree Your 3rd attack or spell on an enemy champion shocks the area around them, dealing 10 damage per level plus 20% of your Bonus Attack Damage and 10% of your Ability Power as Magic damage to enemies in the area (30 second cooldown).
Jungle Changes

*Starting item in the Jungle - as well as Jungle stats have been retuned.(to make up for more expensive pots) * There will be more items you can buy to help you out in the jungle - as there are more early items that are components for your tier 2 jungle item.
Rift Herald
Location/timing:
Spawns at the Baron Pit
First appears at 4:00
Respawns every 5 minutes
Despawns at 19:45 unless in combat; hard despawns at 19:55 no matter what
Encounter details:
Melee-only attacker - but hits pretty hard. Need to be able to take a punch to tank RH.
The Eye will occasionally open, exposing RH to bonus damage on attacks from behind equal to 12% of RH's Max HP as True Damage.
Takes 35% less damage from ranged Autoattacks.
Reward details:
50 global gold to everyone on the killing team
Drops "Doom's Eve" buff to the killer:
10% increase to all Damage (except True Damage) and 40 bonus MS
Enhanced Baron Recall
Enhances nearby minions offensive power, same as Baron buff, with an additional attack speed increase. Does NOT increase their defensive power (don't worry, you won't have to deal with last-hitting Baron buffed minions in lane)
Misc Changes

Will put these into more appropriate categories later on.
The Rift Herald. A new monster that spawns in the baron pit before baron.
Geo changes to make vision less buggy
No more mana pots. Champs that need adjustments because of this will be altered
Talisman's CD is being put back up to 60 seconds as well.
Health pots cost more.
Starting gold is now 500.
Starting items have had their costs readjusted. Maybe new tank starting items.
Flask now restores more mana and health per charge.
Upgraded red trinket no longer gives true sight either
Supports that relied on mana pots got a mp/5 bump at their level 1 stat.
Frostfang has a bump in its regeneration values as it wasn't very cost efficient.
Guinsoo's Rageblade getting unspecified changes.

Hey fronds,
We're deliberately keeping the conversation low-key until worlds passes by (pls KOO), and this might get buried but we're also setting up something I'm cleverly calling the "Dev Corner." You'll see an intro post in there but I'm going to be setting up daily "Open Forum Discussions" until we can do full info-dumps next week. So if you want to throw things out, feel free to keep pinging here or in there.

[–]a_random_superhero 2 points 14 days ago 
When will you be elaborating on jungle changes? Increased cost of HP pots means some change in the jungle - like new early jungle items?

[–]Fgame 2 points 13 days ago 
Yea this is a great question. Here's the high level points for each:
Caitlyn
The zone control marksmen (traps are on a charge system now) New play feel with headshot combos (trap and E trigger a guaranteed headshot on the target)
Miss Fortune
The wombo combo marksmen (ult scaling way better, can crit) New play feel with impure shots replaced with "love tap" new passive that gives bonus damage when swapping targets (this works well with Q)
Kog'Maw
The true glass cannon hyper carry (tons of dmg needs protection) W now doubles ALL attack speed and allows him to break the attack speed cap (but ad is lowered to 60%)
Corki
Magic damage marksmen -> passive now does big magic damage instead of true and all spells now do magic damage New mechanic: Special Delivery -> every ~5m in the game corki gets a special set of bombs in his base that allow him to cast a super mega W with much bigger range and impact
Quinn
The map mobility/roaming marksmen R reworked as a utility focused spell -> 0 cooldown and gives quinn crazy out of combat speed to quickly move around the map, not used for assassination anymore
Graves
We finally made his shotgun a shotgun -> up close burst damage marksmen Basic attacks fire multiple buckshots in a cone -> more damage up close Q reworked to synergize better with the new basic attacks
Holy moly.

Please give Udyr better regen or a mana pool that lets him last more than 10 seconds in lane. He's already pretty boned even WITH mana pots D:

It appears to have legs. It looks like it should be able to walk around but in the clip they showed they stayed in melee range.

[–]arcanition[Arcanition] (NA) 26 points 14 days ago* 
tl;dr:
Marksmen update similar to juggernauts coming for Corki, Miss Fortune, Graves, Caitlyn, Kog'Maw, and Quinn. New/reworked AD items for different strategies of dealing damage
Revamped mastery system, fewer choices that offer more impact (examples: damaging abilities cause targets to bleed or movement speed boost when you deal a large chunk of damage to an enemy champion)
Vision/trinket/support item changes: free trinket upgrades, upgrade tier 2 support items into power tier 3 or slot-efficient sightstone upgrade. Stealth Wards removed, but wards that expire will leave "debris".
New starting items (example: the Cull which is "a light skirmishing AD starting item that provides less defensive stats than Doran’s Blade, but gives bonus gold for killing a set number of minions.")
Potion/flask changes: Health Potions will cost more, Mana Potions are being removed, but upgradable Refillable Potions are being added.
Before Baron spawns, a new neutral monster called The Rift Herald will take its place. Killed it will give a "single target buff focused on early game power and pushing down the lane."

[–]Fluffy017 151 points 14 days ago 
"Our goal is similar to our work with juggernauts, where we targeted a group of champions (in this case six marksmen - Corki, Miss Fortune, Graves, Caitlyn, Kog’Maw, and Quinn) who occupied similar strategic spaces, and gave them a little more ‘uniqueness.'"
But each team only gets 3 bans...how the fuck am I supposed to ban these 6 marksmen post-rework AS WELL AS Darius, Morde, and Garen?!

Youjust need to ban Morde really....

[–]Raxerbou 6 points 14 days ago 
Aight here's how you deal with morde, the reason why he doesn't get permabanned in my elo (high dia 1):
step 1: pick ranged support and any ADC that has some sort of range or damage over time step 2: Make morde cry trying to get cs without losing 40% of his HP

[–]kDart007~Meep noises intensify~ 10 points 14 days ago 
Seems ok but i'm silver and down here everybody insists on giving drake to the enemy team..... so..... you know the rest.... : )

[–]Raxerbou 2 points 14 days ago 
Then pick thresh and just straight up wreck him before he gets dragon (asuming youre a supp main with that flair)

[–]kDart007~Meep noises intensify~ 5 points 14 days ago 
Yes, I am a (VERY BAD) supp main :)

[–]Simetraa 3 points 13 days ago 
Git gud.

[–]GenericUser_27 1 point 13 days ago 
So, I main sup and I've found playing Sona can absolutely destroy Morde in lane. He has a difficult time farming because you can poke him through his sustain and when he tries to dive at 6 you have your ult. She's fairly easy to learn, so give it a try. I'm guessing you enjoy Braum, but he doesn't have the sustain or damage to fight Morde. Best of luck mate.

[–]kDart007~Meep noises intensify~ 1 point 13 days ago 
Thanks and I also enjoy playing Sona from time to time.

[–]Folsomdsf 1 point 13 days ago 
I pick dr. mundo botlane vs morde and just kill him at level 2, it's.. pretty funny.

[–]Deathmarked -2 points 14 days ago

[–]HedgeOfGlory 1 point 13 days ago 
Darius, Morde, Garen? Where have you been?
For me it's Tahm, Kindred, Morde that are the must-bans these days. Toplane gets a broken champ - that's just how it is - but Olaf, Darius, Fiora, Garen...you just hope your teammate picks a broken one as well.

[–]dnl101 1 point 13 days ago 
At least 5 of them will be OP.
But Garen? Who the fuck bans Garen?

[–]JesterOfKings5 1 point 13 days ago 
Every person will get 1 ban next season so 10 bans for everything you listed PLUS one free extra ban!

[–]DragonPup 176 points 14 days ago 
If the Rift Herald is going to hang out before Baron spawns, I hope when Baron does initially spawn there's some badass murder animation going as Nashor takes his rightful place.

[–]GioMike 31 points 14 days ago 
that would be so cool.

[–]mckenny37 -3 points 13 days ago 
Like Rift Herald turns into a cocoon at 19 minutes. The herald evolves throughout the minute to the badass monster he was always meant to be. Right at 20 minutes the shell explodes revealing Baron No, Sneaky ummmm, TROGDOR. Baron appears and is all like wtf Baron No,Sneaky ummmm, TROGDOR, this my spot. Epic battle ensues

What I find interesting is that it has 8k Health, and they just cut through it at level 7
Edit: Its Yi's Wuju Style doing true damage

It's probably the feature where when its eye is open, you do 12% max hp true damage with attacks from behind.

[–]yodasonics 3 points 14 days ago 
The post says before 15 so I imagine he dies there and then baron spawns at 20:00 as usual.

[–]EarlHarewood 1 point 14 days ago 
omg rito pls

[–]Equeon 1 point 13 days ago 
Considering he's called the "Herald", I hope there's some dramatic little "summoning ritual" animation as he sacrifices himself to the Baron.

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
Heard it's only there until 15 minutes and Baron spawns at 20.

[–]NGHTMR3 110 points 14 days ago 
Baby Nashor before 15 minutes 

[–]xormx 13 points 13 days ago 
I think it's basically like a red or blue buff that gives one person Baron buff. This is actually huge, lane swaps will be much more viable now because there's an objective in top lane to contest.
I wouldn't be surprised if the duo bot meta starts to crumble this season.

[–]PM-ME-YOUR-LOLIS 5 points 13 days ago 
Fucking tryndamere with baron buffs.
Thats one way of nerfing tp.

[–]AnAngryFetus 3 points 13 days ago

[–]Teemonomicon 1 point 13 days ago 
Swapping in soloQ? Nobody swaps in any elo.

[–]simjanes2k 1 point 13 days ago 
to what, roam support? or duo mid?

[–]xormx 1 point 13 days ago 
Duo mid probably, so the duo lane can control both objectives

[–]Moloko_Vellocet1BR 1 point 13 days ago 
Duo mid like ADC/Supp? Then you have to seend your 'mid' to bottom if you choose a champ who requires blue buff you'll get a problem if you are in blue side.

[–]xormx 1 point 13 days ago 
You would send your blue-dependent champ to whichever side your blue buff is on.

[–]Moloko_Vellocet1BR 1 point 13 days ago 
Hmmm, can you imagine a Orianna x Darius? Actualy I'd like to see.

[–]Vman733 1 point 14 days ago 
i wonder how the ad itemization will affect other ad champs besides marksmen

[–]HappyMune 1 point 13 days ago 
I hope it's solely limited for marksmen, they can do a pass for AD melee next. Too much item mixing just leads to it being op on AD assassins and the items being nerfed again down the line

Yes.

[–]fcerial 15 points 13 days ago 
Any pre-preseason insight you can give us about essence reaver?

[–]Reinboom 84 points 13 days ago 
Sure. It's being adapted specifically for characters that want to weave auto attacks and spells. It's also no longer being compared to bloodthirster, and being compared to IE more.
Still gives mana. Still gives CDR. How and how much are both different. And now takes the crit chance you get from other items and turns it into CDR (upwards of +30% CDR).
This is VERY good on Lucian.

[–]soEckie 6 points 14 days ago 
Any other item changes you can talk about?

[–]Reinboom 11 points 14 days ago 
Sure, but there's a LOT of item changes so I won't be able to go over everything right now. Feel free to ask and I will answer where I can.

[–]qtsupportgirl 6 points 13 days ago 
I think the big one on everyone's mind is: what's happening to Infinity Edge? Is it something that every ADC still wants (ala Rabadon's), or does it fulfill a specific niche?

[–]shawnsullivan93 5 points 13 days ago 
Are we seeing any meaningful changes to the choice between PD vs statick shiv?

[–]Reinboom 7 points 13 days ago 
Yes. PD has new passives now. It has no built in movement speed, so it's a commitment.
PD gives +12% Movement Speed while near enemy champions. And you gain a percent damage reduction against the last champion you attacked. It's isolate and kill. It has lost some stats for this.

[–]GiantR 1 point 13 days ago 
Turns into CDR means you lose the crit but gain the CDR. Or do you just gain the CDR as a bonus.

[–]jbaum517[Daquanda] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
It means you will scale bonus CDR off of your crit without losing crit. It's going to be OP on lucian/corki.

[–]HatefulWretch 1 point 13 days ago 
That sounds like an item Pantheon would be very, very, very happy to build.

[–]FirCone 1 point 13 days ago 
Why? Does Pantheon usually build any crit items at all? I think they made the crit to CDR conversion specifically so that melee AD casters like him don't have an incentive to get it because they almost never build crit. And since it's not so comparable to BT anymore, I'd say Pantheon will never buy ER again.

[–]HatefulWretch 1 point 13 days ago 
Pantheon wants to build CDR more than anything else (and his Q can crit). If you can get CDR for free while building crit, then that sounds rather exciting. Right now, you might build brutalizer into hydra (for waveclear); that might turn into essence reaver into shiv or something, if you're fed.
Pure theory crafting with zero facts, so it might well be appalling. But...

[–]FirCone 3 points 13 days ago 
But that's the thing, building crit chance doesn't benefit him in the first place, only the multiplier from IE that applies to his low health AA and Q. I can't see a Statikk Shiv Pantheon being very successful compared to the straight AD and Armor Pen version. (Also Black Cleaver exists.)

[–]CavedogRIP[🍰] 1 point 13 days ago

Obvious synergy with the cull item

[–]coldize 1 point 14 days ago 
He's probably going to get some limited balance changes in addition to being affected by AD itemization changes. The champions that are "targeted" are getting heavy gameplay changes on the order of a small rework.

[–]Buttpudding 0 points 14 days ago 
Hes just Graves light now. And its sad.

[–]Shadow-Striker 3 points 14 days ago 
The point is making adcs that occupy the same niche different from each other.
If what you say is true, then changing graves will mean that changing Lucian is not necessary.

[–]FurathBeauty and Grace 1 point 14 days ago 
Well with Graves getting changes maybe he won't be a Graves clone but that doesn't' make him good.

Edit: Format

[–]fox112 476 points 14 days ago 
we targeted a group of champions (in this case six marksmen - Corki, Miss Fortune, Graves, Caitlyn, Kog’Maw, and Quinn) who occupied similar strategic spaces, and gave them a little more ‘uniqueness.’ We’re doing this in two ways: how the marksman plays, and how the team plays with them.
So... mini games.

[–]AkuraJebia[AvB Akura] (EU-W) 109 points 14 days ago

[–]Golden_Kumquat[Golden Kumquat] (NA) 47 points 14 days ago

[–]icito[icito] (EU-NE) 1 point 13 days ago 
Bigger range would probably break some ADCs.

[–]LeslieTim 1 point 13 days ago* 
Looks like there might be a +attack range item.
I doubt that, I still remember people pivoting a +attack range to Xypherous 1 or 2 years ago, and he said constantly changing autoattack ranges during a game is something they want to avoid because it would be very confusing for the opponents (also it might become mandatory to take turrets).
Tristana is an exception because it grows gradually and it's part of her character, and all other range-augmenting adcs are gated by cooldowns (like KogMaw and Twitch).
EDIT: apparently they did add an item that increases range (Rapid Firecannon), but as I thought it doesn't increase it permanently, only after a number of autoattacks and then resets back.

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
If it's an item that scales higher with the less range you have, it's k.

[–]xxLetheanxx 1 point 13 days ago

[–]MrMeltJr -1 points 13 days ago 
So... creating adc item diversity by making an item that is all but mandatory on adcs?

[–]Golden_Kumquat[Golden Kumquat] (NA) 2 points 13 days ago 
How is it all but mandatory? It doesn't matter how far away you are if you don't deal any damage.

[–]MrMeltJr 1 point 13 days ago 
Later in the game when you already have damage, increasing range is insane.

[–]Not_A_Rioter 2 points 13 days ago 
We don't even know the numbers yet... The effect sounds strong but we have no idea how it's even costed. It's far too early to say that it's mandatory.

[–]MrMeltJr -1 points 13 days ago 
It's going to be feast or famine. Either its cost effective and good on everybody, or its not and its a niche 5th or 6th item that rarely gets built. Range increase is good on any adc, so either everybody builds it or it sucks.

[–]GiantR 2 points 13 days ago 
In the game Dawngate there was an range increasing Item. It was built, but it wasn't like ALWAYS build territory.
I'm sure it can be balanced.

[–]ActualContent 44 points 14 days ago 
Can't wait to watch competitive games where the trist kills the tower even easier than she does now.

[–]ImpostersEnd 3 points 14 days ago 
I have a feeling their will be an item to increase attack range.

[–]jawbit 8 points 14 days ago 
Ranged only. Unless you want Trynd murdering you from his own backline

[–]ImpostersEnd 5 points 14 days ago 
Nah that Tristana has only about 125 more range than she normally would at level 18, so Tryndamere would have 250 range rather than 125.

[–]Combarishnigm 2 points 13 days ago 
My guess is that Rapid Fire increases her range for the duration.
But the description of the changes make it sound like you can opt into a 'I want to kill towers!' mastery, so maybe...

[–]ImpostersEnd 1 point 13 days ago 
Nah she wasn't mentioned in the ADC reworks and that would just make her the same as Kog'Maw if it was her own skill that did it.

[–]Combarishnigm 1 point 13 days ago 
Well, they did say that other ADCs were getting changes, just not as huge/comprehensive.
But it could very easily be an item or a mastery (only on towers, I'd assume, if it's a mastery).

[–]KanyeEast420 2 points 13 days ago 
http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/whbJ5lH1-the-preseasoning-day-1-open-forum-discussion?comment=00c40000
Looks like you were right. It's similar to Statikk Shiv in that it only increases range when charges are maxed out.

[–]Kyrond 1 point 14 days ago 
I think it just means she has a niche, scaling range ADC with heavy AA focus.

[–]Sinsie9698 1 point 14 days ago 
I'm kinda thinking that it's gunna be a pretty costly item of sorts, and it'll be pretty hard to get so deep to just goon the towers. Still strong af.

[–]DullLelouch 1 point 13 days ago 
She used to do this before her rework. So it will probably be fine.

[–]Frohirrim 41 points 14 days ago 
I feel like those don't occupy the same strategic space at all. Like, Kogmaw, Quinn, and Graves? They are so different.

[–]tostito1 39 points 14 days ago 
When Kindred was released, I have friend who just played the shit outta her (hit Mastery 5 in the first week).
So often times he'd jungle her, and if I was bot I'd play wacky lanes. Double Bruiser, theme lanes (Jarvan and Garen, Lissandra and Sejuani, Brand Annie), or bring a mage bot.
Got me thinking what if there were a few other options for ADC junglers than Kindred? I think a reworked Quinn has a lot of potential to be a jungler, imagine ulted Quinn flying out of the jungle. Twitch also could be a great jungler.

[–]PixieConspiracy 23 points 13 days ago 
Twitch was a great jungler back when devourer first came out.

[–]laxboy119 4 points 13 days ago

[–]Anjoran 4 points 14 days ago 
I already play Quinn in the jungle. With her passive and her blind, she mitigates a huge amount of damage, and great early clears. With items she's like a Rengar coming out of the jungle to assassinate your carry. It's awesome.

[–]PuchongG 2 points 13 days ago 
Oh shit, not Twitch Jungle again...

[–]RuneKatashima 2 points 13 days ago 
Vayne is a really good jungler actually, it's just her scaling is toward the lategame so her early clear sucks. The ability to max%HPtruedamage a jungle mob is nice and you can ALWAYS stun the big one to the wall.
Twitch is decent but he's a ganker.
Teemo is really good too.

[–]Frohirrim 1 point 14 days ago 
Well, they took away all combat skills and basic attacks from her ult and removed her blind in the rework. So I don't know if that makes her a good jungler.

[–]erock0546 1 point 13 days ago 
Quinn struggles a bit in the jungle
but yeah I agree, although if your'e in silver and the enemy has locked in a vayne with no junglers, just dodge, vayne jungle can be insanely strong.

[–]DNYzt4r 1 point 13 days ago 
play AP mf in bot, that shit is funny :D

[–]mcdg2 1 point 14 days ago 
I think more ADCs have the potential to jungle than people realize. Most have some tools to get them into a gank quickly, and/or a slow. And of course they benefit massively from red buff. The main issue is sustain for the first few clears. Imagine if Kindred's heal passive was on a jungle item...

[–]ADCSaltyGirl 0 points 14 days ago 
Twitch also could be a great jungler.
Please don't ever bring that back. Ever.

[–]laxboy119 4 points 13 days ago

[–]xxLetheanxx 0 points 13 days ago

[–]KbloeUIEOssa 6 points 14 days ago 
I dont think that when they were talking about strategic space they meant that these specific 6 champions overlap with each other, but rather that they overlap with other ADCs which is true.
Cait is very similar to Tristana, Graves is almost identical to Lucian, Kog overlaps with Jinx and Quinn and MF have just very weird kits which doesnt result in some niche (ok maybe MF is great in wombos but as i saw they will propably keep this)

[–]Frohirrim 1 point 14 days ago 
Ok that makes a lot more sense.

[–]Lavoisier21 2 points 14 days ago 
He probably means the occupy the same strategic space as other ADCs, not amongst themselves.

[–]mattiejj 0 points 14 days ago 
Corki: spellbased midgame adc. A lot of magic damage.
Kog'maw: Hypercarry.
Miss fortune: AoE comps, lane bully.
Graves: Lane bully, spellbased adc.
Quinn: I have no clue, she isn't picked anyway.
The only two who are a bit similar are Graves and Fortune.

[–]maxg424 1 point 14 days ago 
Quinn's basically an Assassin

[–]Jooota 1 point 13 days ago 
I think it's not between them.
Corki and Ezreal
Kog'maw with Jinx or even Vayne
MF is weird
Graves and lucian.
Quinn is weird too.

[–]arkhammer 12 points 14 days ago 
I think Lucian just had a set of changes with his W being procced from his teammates. I'm pretty sure the Graves changes are to push him farther away from Lucian than Lucian farther away from Graves' play style.

[–]Hawkson2020 5 points 14 days ago 
That was one change. And it doesn't fix the overarching issue that Lucian is still in the shitter with Aatrox and Galio

[–]Leviathan_LV 3 points 14 days ago

[–]Sensonin 2 points 14 days ago

He's fun to play against dot mages, oh you wanted to hurt me, I'll just press W

[–]HedgeOfGlory 2 points 13 days ago 
Arent those issues just his numbers?
He doesn't deal enough damage atm. But he's so strong inherently kit-wise with his ability to force trades, that if they give him good numbers e's stupid.
Although tbh with tanks what they are, and botlane a huge 5v5 gangbang, I think 'OP' lucian from a few months ago would actually be ok now. I mean he ain't gonna hurt the Darius lategame, he can't stomp early (cos everyone is in his lane all the time), so he'd be a high-skillcap snowball carry.

[–]Kadexe[Carnicore] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
He doesn't need a rework for that to be fixed.

We found Quinn to be outperformed in her role as a marksman-duelist by champions such as Vayne, and outclassed as an assassin by Zed and Talon.
As such Quinn and Valour has been reworked to operate as two champions players must control. Upon spawning into Summoner's Rift, the Quinn elects another teammate to be the 'Tag Partner', similar to Kalista. Quinn and the Tag Partner generate a Trust Stack that increases with every kill that two have participated in (10 stacks) and lane minion last hit achieved by either (1 stack). At 50 stacks, the Tag Partner can trigger Quinn's passive damage on enemies she has marked. At 100 stacks, this passive damage becomes 10% of targets max health as true damage.
Quinn can ult to call upon Valour, where Valour will sweep up Tag Partner anywhere on the Rift for 30 seconds, giving the Tag Partner Valour's skillset. The Tag Partner controls Valour, but her abilities are not as responsive as players may remember from release. Instead, the Tag Partner's controls are determined by Trust Stacks. Too low (<100 stacks)? Valour just might throw you off when you're trying to get the bird to swipe at enemies.

Ult does % missing health true damage and gives AD and % armor pen while knocking back all nearby units and stunning them if they collide with a wall or another unit. Just like an actual rocket does. Edit: Bug upon release that causes you to get stunned by any ward, allied or friendly. Coded as minions.

RiotScruffy (NA) - about 3 hours ago
Yea this is a great question. Here's the high level points for each:
Caitlyn
The zone control marksmen (traps are on a charge system now)
New play feel with headshot combos (trap and E trigger a guaranteed headshot on the target)
Miss Fortune
The wombo combo marksmen (ult scaling way better, can crit)
New play feel with impure shots replaced with "love tap" new passive that gives bonus damage when swapping targets (this works well with Q)
Kog'Maw
The true glass cannon hyper carry (tons of dmg needs protection)
W now doubles ALL attack speed and allows him to break the attack speed cap (but ad is lowered to 60%)[the auto attack cap speed is 5.0 with W active]
Corki
Magic damage marksmen -> passive now does big magic damage instead of true and all spells now do magic damage
New mechanic: Special Delivery -> every ~5m in the game corki gets a special set of bombs in his base[the fountain] that allow him to cast a super mega W with much bigger range and impact.[He gets a free homeguard effect once he picks up this package]
Quinn
The map mobility/roaming marksmen
R reworked as a utility focused spell -> 0 cooldown and gives quinn crazy out of combat speed to quickly move around the map, not used for assassination anymore[R is toggle. No word if she starts with it like nidalee]
Graves
We finally made his shotgun a shotgun -> up close burst damage marksmen
Basic attacks fire multiple buckshots in a cone -> more damage up close. [It is possible to position so that you don't actually push if you want to freeze]
Q reworked to synergize better with the new basic attacks
Item Changes

Putting these into one post for ease of us. These are some of the item changes for marksmen.
Riot Reinboom (NA) 44 minutes ago
Infinity Edge is slightly weaker now (little less AD), we shifted power elsewhere so it's less automatic and so that we could add cooler things to the Marksman space.
Essence Reaver scales its CDR off of your critical strike chance so that it works as a big core item (think IE space). It can now give upwards of +30% CDR.
Phantom Dancer does stuff other than just be straight up damage. Bonus movement speed while near your opponents and you take last damage from the last champion you hit. Isolate and kill people, basically.
Rapid Firecannon charges up like Shiv, but when charged instead of prepping you for the thunder, increases your attack range and gives you a fiery hit at the end.
Shiv does even more damage versus minions. It's specialized further into being the bursty clearing tool.
Hurricane now crits and the bolts crit. Also movement speed. It's in the PD / Shiv space now, so it should be an option for more Marksman.
Executioner's Calling is back, but it's a bit different and cheaper. Also it's a component item. It builds into something new.
Last Whisper is now a component item. It builds into new things.
There's something called Giant Slayer. It hurts health dudes.
Merc scimitar has Lifesteal, you should feel comfortable taking it over BT.
Death's Dance exist. It has something like Lifesteal but better. Also it "delays" damage.
And tons of changes all over the place. This is just some of the marks targeted ones.

[–]Acry 0 points 14 days ago

[–]sephrinx 0 points 13 days ago* 
Fucking hope not, when they introduced minigames is when the game took a sharp decline in fun, for myself and my friends anyway.
I played more than 2000 games in season 3, about 1200 in S4, and about... 100 in S5? It just gets worse and worse for my enjoyment. Idk.
I just hope that they add a vast amount of new items this season. Like, 20-30 new items. The game play got super stale and itemization was a joke.

[–]RagAndABone 2 points 14 days ago 
I'm actually a pretty supportive jungler who buys sightstone after jungle item and boots 1, but I can definitely see this impacting people with other playstyles/buildpaths.

[–]SenaIkaza 2 points 14 days ago 
I wish we could just go back to it being considered mostly support and jungle's job to ward. Supports still aren't as impactful as other roles outside of a few exceptions, and the impact we use to be able to have by controlling vision for the team was very noticeable. Now unless I'm playing Tahm Kench or Thresh, I feel less useful than I did in Season 2. Also, warding being a "team effort" is shit. In lower ELOs where I am it's still basically only the support and sometimes the jungle warding. So there's basically just less wards and less trying to control vision than before.

Pretty sure Baron isn't gone, they specifically said something before 15 minutes.
we’re exploring ways to bring some relevancy to the north so top laners can feel like they're interacting with their team BEFORE the 15 minute mark.

Won't increasing cost of health potions screw over a lot of junglers that don't have great sustain in the early game like Wukong for example?

[–]RiotXypherous 13 points 13 days ago 
It definitely could've had that effect. The starting jungle item(s) and jungle statistics have needed to be redone to account for both the changes in masteries as well as other systems.

[–]SamWhite 1 point 13 days ago 
Any word on the jungle changes? Or a rework on devourer to make the item screw up soloqueue less? Anything?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
None of the tier 3 items have been adjusted. There's been talks about adjusting them - but no real concrete plans as a core jungle pass wasn't the primary focus of this preseason.

[–]SamWhite 1 point 13 days ago 
That's a real shame. Jungle has a real lack of diversity right now, and devourer benefits the soloqueue destroyers who use it and no-one else. I really hope that item gets a pass at some point.

[–]Gtyyler[YourHereCuzYouSuckAtDota] (KOR) 2 points 14 days ago 
They mentioned "refillable" potions so I'm guessing they work like flasks in Path of Exile (kill enemies to regain charges). This might help junglers instead.

[–]Ronflexronflex 132 points 14 days ago 
You're disrupting my meme, check your privileges you logical shitlord.
No but i knew about it, i just find the change pretty harsh (especially since i'm a silver shitter who already has to fight to death with my team mates to make them upgrade trinkets/swap to red trinket as support/generally try to get vision) :D
On a side note, they mention some changes to sightstone related to support items, even tho i couldn't understand if they wanted to make it an upgrade of support items, or if there will be a tier 3 sightstone built from ruby/regular sightstone and support items... will be interesting to see :p

[–]RiotXypherous 76 points 13 days ago 
Sightstone has two upgrade paths:
You can take the default upgrade to Ruby Sightstone which grants you 10% Active Item CDR.
or
You can combine your base sightstone with your tier 2 support item (Nomad's Medallion, Targon's Brace, Frostfang) and get a Sightstone that has Nomad's Medallion, Targon's Brace and Frostfang's passives.
However if you choose that route - you cannot buy Talisman of Ascension, Frost Queen's Claim or Face of the Mountain.
So you get two options here:
Buy the 'Combined' Sightstone and save an inventory slot for powerful passive items or defense items.
Buy Ruby Sightstone and the Tier 3 support active - and get reduced item cdr on the tier 3 support active and any future actives you might buy.

[–]omglolbbqroflmao(EU-W) 4 points 13 days ago

[–]Golden_NozdormuWTB Friends 2 points 13 days ago 
Ah, you guys mean the 700 AP support Annie. Gotcha.

[–]Ronflexronflex 2 points 14 days ago 
Rito's answers :O i'm famous now. Jk
That's an interesting take on ruby sightstone with the active item cdr. I have a slight concern tho, i already feel like Talisman of ascension is available way too often nowadays with the lowered cd from a while ago (5.10 ?) and the Intelligence utility mastery...
I guess you can't reveal too much, but do you have plans to revamp this mastery/nerf the cd on Talisman a bit ?
Cuz depending on how heavily Talisman/mikaels/locket are changed, the least "slot effective" idea of going for Ruby + Talisman could get really broken imo. Especially since supports rarely max out on items and thus aren't that concerned with slot efficiency.

[–]RiotXypherous 7 points 14 days ago 
The active item CDR mastery is pretty much gone with the new mastery system (I believe. I'd have to double check one more time.)
Talisman's CD is being put back up to 60 seconds as well.
This may be too much of a nerf in the long run - but for the outset - I just resync'ed all the CD's of the active items again to 60 seconds for each of them.

[–]Ronflexronflex 1 point 13 days ago 
Aight thanks for the infos !

[–]pastamancer8081 1 point 13 days ago 
Also, does the 10% CDR received on the new Ruby Sightstone apply to the ward charging on the item itself or not? Same question for trinkets.

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
10% CDR on active items doesn't apply to ammo recharge timers - otherwise, I'd think we'd have to make it work for things like Sheen - which would be wonky.

[–]jokerrebellion[FiumeBeato] (SEA) 2 points 13 days ago 
for powerful passive items or defense items. Buy Ruby Sightstone and the Tier 3 support active - and get reduced item cdr on the tier 3 support active and any future actives you might buy.
How would you get to choose which item you're activating?

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
You don't - you just get active item CDR which will apply to all actives you have - including the tier 3 support active.

[–]Omnilatent 1 point 13 days ago 
You can combine your base sightstone with your tier 2 support item (Nomad's Medallion, Targon's Brace, Frostfang) and get a Sightstone that has Nomad's Medallion, Targon's Brace and Frostfang's passives.
This seems extremely powerful to me as empty slots are very important to me as a support (pinks, health pots)

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
I'd hope so. You're giving up Talisman, Face or Frost Queen's actives for it.

[–]Omnilatent 1 point 13 days ago 
I like this change as this makes forsqueens claim a thousand times better than the current state. Don't know how it will affect the other two tbh as they are pretty strong.

[–]Antimonyx 0 points 13 days ago 
My worry is that in the long run it will still be better to just sell spell thief instead of upgrading it. Upgrading it to frostfang essentially negates a portion of the gold earned from spell thief largely for the sake of gaining more gold in the long run, so it ends up delaying other items that offer more useful immediate benefits. The extra damage on the tribute proc falls of quickly, and the stats are fairly mediocre, combining it with a sight stone costs more money and removes the stats, making that upgrade path an even bigger delay. The main draw to combining it with sight stone is to save space, but the same can be accomplished by selling the item when space becomes an issue.
I'm getting a bit muddled, but the issue is that using the new frostfang+Sightstone puts you in a 500+gold deficit, so it only becomes useful after however many minutes/procs it takes to, turn a profit with it since the passive isn't particularly powerful past a certain point. It's essentially delaying your build path to reach a full build faster. This is more of an issue with frostfang then the new sight stone system, since the extra healing from nomads or targon's is always going to be useful, but the extra damage from frostfang is fairly meh by comparison.
Hopefully I'm not missing something obvious with all of this, I'm not very good at all the item efficiency math. Let me know if I am!

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
combining it with a sight stone costs more money and removes the stats, making that upgrade path an even bigger delay.
Combining it with the sightstone won't remove the stats at all. You'll keep all the original stats the both items had. So it'll be an HP/AP/MP Regen/Tribute item with Wards.
since the extra healing from nomads or targon's is always going to be useful, but the extra damage from frostfang is fairly meh by comparison.
Right - this is why we've also adjusted Frostfang's mana regeneration to increase it by a noticeable margin - Frostfang doesn't quite hold up its weight when you consider the functionality that it gives - especially with its current iteration on live.

[–]Antimonyx 0 points 13 days ago 
Ah, thanks for clearing that up~!

[–]HF_Rin 1 point 13 days ago

[–]Miraai 1 point 13 days ago 
how do you use double active on 1 itemslot with a combined sightstone/face for example?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
You can't combine sightstone with face of the mountain.
You can only combine sightstone with their tier 2 equivalents - targon's brace, frostfang and nomad's medallion - none of which have actives.

[–]fortevn 1 point 13 days ago 
Oh I see, so you have a sightstone and those supportive item passives. However is it just a "combination"? Is there some upgraded stats? Like can you have a bit more movementspeed/regen when you choose to upgrade with Medallion?
And Ruby Sightstone is just regular ruby stone with 10% active ITEM CDR? So if you don't buy active item it's a waste?
I feel something is kinda off, but I can't seem to see what it is. The changes look rather unattractive, but it's certainly better than the current sightstones.

[–]Narabug 1 point 13 days ago 
Option One: Ruby Sightstone is still going to be last or second-last buy. Boots, Sightstone, T3 Support Item + <Active Item 2>, and then it might be worth upgrading it, but still probably not until you have a third active item. In any case, it means Ruby is still your last purchase, and only slightly less devastating as an item slot in a 60-minute game.
Option Two: This is effectively a measure to simply give supports an additional item slot. Again, it will only be useful as a last upgrade, when everything else has been purchased, in extremely long games.
With most competitive games this year being under 30 minutes, and the vast majority of supports finishing boots, Sightstone, and one full item if they're lucky, it seems that the changes are directly aimed at lower ELO or unranked play, where games typically last longer. There have been so many good suggestions for changes to Sightstone/Support items on the boards to add variety and differing build options, and it's a shame to see them all be ignored in favor of simply slightly improving the last upgrade a support will make or adding a 7th item slot if the game goes on too long.

[–]AdamPalma 0 points 13 days ago 
The Combinedstone has all three items' passives, or just the one you combine it with? If all three, Targon and Frostfang are in opposition with one another. Will using Targon's passive be ignored by Frostfang's passive?

[–]RiotXypherous 5 points 13 days ago 
There are three 'combinedstone'
Eye of the Oasis = Nomad's Medallion + Sightstone.
Eye of the Watchers = Frostfang + Sightstone.
Eye of the Equinox = Targon's Brace + Sightstone.
Hope that clears it up for you.

[–]sweetleafxD 0 points 13 days ago 
what about Lee Sin? Won't this hinder him because he kinda needs to buy a sightstone yet isn't a support?

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
I don't actually think so - aside from the fact that there are a couple changes to warding in general that should be beneficial for him...
Lee Sin + Eye of the Equinox means he gets a Sightstone with even more tank stats + the ability to execute minions and heal himself.
And depending how many active items he'd like to build (Probably very little - now that I think about it) - Ruby might actually have some interesting stats for him.

[–]sweetleafxD 1 point 13 days ago 
Thank you Xyph
Now that I think about it Nomad's Sighstone on junglers could actually be pretty cool in later stages (when carries tend to clear the whole jungle) by providing the jungler with some aditional gold as teams wave-clear minions.
I've always wondered what your opinion is on the double-sightstone trends we see now. Will next season push warding towards a more trinket centric team effort, or will the fact that we no longer have sight wards reward multiple sightstones even further?

I think teleporting to wards should just be removed. Allow only teleport to a lane (turret or minion) and then walk to the fight.
It's too reliable to enter a teamfight right now, as long as anyone on your team has a ward ready.

[–]HF_Rin 2 points 13 days ago* 
Main problem is players are using for get back to lanes faster.
I think they need disable tp on turrets. And increase cd of tp overall.
Also u can kill minion u tp on. And tp got cancled.
Another option if u tp on ward and some one swipe it tp get cancel.

[–]Deletemorde 1 point 13 days ago 
I completely disagree. Top main here. Imo, they should remove the tp cdr when tp'ing to turrets. Tp to wards is not op, and it brings a lot more strategy and team synergy when players can tp to wards to get into fights. Even marin himself said he wished the meta had MORE tp plays, and less 1v1 in the top lane. Only being able to tp to towers/minions would be dull and it would be very disadvantagous for the team laying behind, since you most likely have few turrets and your minions will never go far outside the base. So basically free Baron for the team ahead whenever they want

[–]lslands 0 points 13 days ago 
There really isn't any strategy to warding a bush behind your enemy laner, or behind drag/baron

[–]Deletemorde 1 point 13 days ago 
Yes there is. If you really think there isn't then you are narrow minded. Most of the time you can't ward it yourself. That'll get you killed. You need a numbers advantage and brute force your way into position to place that ward. The pro players do a LOT of planning ahead when warding shit. It isn't as simple as you make it

TL;DR (also includes info from PBE boards)
Marksmen updates, with specific focus on
Caitlyn:
Zone control marksman (traps are on a charge system now)
New play feel with headshot combos (trap and E trigger a guaranteed headshot on the target)
Corki:
Magic damage marksman, passive now does big magic damage instead of true and all spells now do magic damage
New mechanic: Special Delivery -> every ~5m in the game corki gets a special set of bombs in his base that allow him to cast a super mega W with much bigger range and impact
Graves:
We finally made his shotgun a shotgun -> up close burst damage marksmen
Basic attacks fire multiple buckshots in a cone -> more damage up close (sweet jesus my body is ready)
Q reworked to synergize better with the new basic attacks
Kog'Maw:
The true glass cannon hyper carry (tons of dmg needs protection)
W now doubles ALL attack speed and allows him to break the attack speed cap (but ad is lowered to 60%)
More info here
MF:
The wombo combo marksman (ult scaling way better, can crit)
New play feel with impure shots replaced with "love tap" new passive that gives bonus damage when swapping targets (this works well with Q)
Quinn:
The map mobility/roaming marksman
R reworked as a utility focused spell -> 0 cooldown and gives quinn crazy out of combat speed to quickly move around the map, not used for assassination anymore (sounds similar to HotS mounts)
More info here
Marksman item rework similar to the AP item rework. Major Essence Reaver buffs, new item by the name of Rapid Firecannon, IE nerfs, etc.
Other marksmen changes, but those are the big ones.
Masteries
Each tier offers base stats plus a choice of three gameplay-altering "keystone masteries."
Offense T1: Fury(AS) and Sorcery(CDR) 5 points each.
Offense T2: Double-Edged Sword, Butcher/Feast/something similar, 1 unknown, 1 point each.
Offense T3: Arcane Mastery(flat AP) and Spell Vamp, 5 points each.
Offense T4: Brute Force(AD/level), Evasive(reduce damage from AoE spells), 1 unknown, 1 point each
Offense T5: Brutal Strikes(Armor/Magic Penetration) and Dangerous Game, 5 points each.
Offense T6: Choice between one of three masteries. Example from PBE boards: Thunderlord's Decree: 3-hit mechanic that procs statikk-shiv like effect, scales on AD and AP.
This is just based on the icons in the picture, the actual effects could be different. It looks like each tier that costs only one point will require putting five points into one option from the previous tier, i.e. in order to take Brute Force you need 5 points in either Arcane Mastery or Spell Vamp.
Interesting point: 5 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 18 mastery points if you invest just enough in one mastery tree to get the T6 keystone mastery, or so it would seem. Maybe total mastery points are reduced from 30 or keystone masteries will require more points, but my guess is that you'll be able to invest all the way down one tree and split your 12 other points to pick up one or two tiers in other trees.
Vision and support items:
SIGHT(green) WARDS REMOVED FROM THE GAME.
Trinket upgrades are now free.
More sightstone upgrades.
Wards leave debris when killed to help track warding habits.
Starting Items:
Health potion cost increase.
Mana potions removed.
Sustain items like Flask probably more powerful to compensate for this.
New item: Cull: AD item which provides a power spike after a certain amount of cs. Probably two other new starting items to complement Doran's Ring and Doran's shield.
These new starting items do not replace Doran items, they simply complement them.
Map balance:
There's a new monster near top lane that gives a large early game/pushing/vision buff.

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
The masteries on one tier you said would have AP or Spell vamp what happens if you playing someone like master yi

[–]peterfmutch(NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
They're the icons for AP or Spell Vamp, their actual effects might change. If not, maybe you put 5 points into the other mastery in the previous tier?

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
It would make much more sense if on one tier there was things that gave flat ap or ad on the next spell vamp or life steal but who knows

Ok i need to know if hp pots cost more, is jungle getting new starting items, or hunters machete free or cost less, cause the people that struggle with clearing would have to back after like two camps

[–]Zireall 1 point 14 days ago 
probably more "jungle diversity" AGAIN :")

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
HP pots cost more.
There are two jungle starting items - targetted for different attributes.
Jungle has had a light stat pass to compensate for the loss of early defensive jungle masteries.
Both starting items will be required in order to upgrade to your tier 2 jungle item - so if you have to back after two camps, there will always be something you can buy to get better jungle clear.

So far im only worried about the removal of mana pots. Every time i back when i play mid, i buy items/health/mana. If i dont have mana pots, there are just way too many casters who will suffer. Unless everyones mana regen is being upped so it matches a running mana pot.

[–]Juliandroid98SKTelecom T1 2 points 13 days ago

It's pretty evident control mages are superior at the moment in almost every respect.

[–]IcemanHotty 15 points 14 days ago* 
So... removing Stealth Wards. Does it affect Sight Stone?
Edit: I got it, guys.

[–]DXCharger 18 points 14 days ago 
This is my biggest concern. The post mentions Sightstone still being in the game, so my guess is no. But then it sounds like we might be returning to Season 2 where the supports were the ones who controlled vision primarily which Riot did not seem to like.

[–]ericpenguin 7 points 14 days ago 
I don't think that will happen since Supports already place wards to the cap.

[–]Dmienduerst 8 points 14 days ago 
No it sounds like its the exact opposite as sight stone is now integrated into the Trinket system so anyone can get the new sight stone.

[–]coldize 10 points 14 days ago 
What? No, that's not right at all.
Sightstone will remain the item it is now but it will have joint upgrades with gold generation items for better end-game support items.
How in the world did you interpret sightstone as being "integerated into the Trinket system"?
Solo laners are going to be more reliant on their trinkets (and free trinket upgrades) to contribute vision.

[–]Dmienduerst -2 points 14 days ago 
My point is that Sightstone as it is right now is probably going to be one of the free upgrade paths for everyone since they are removing green wards. Sightstone is going to be a new fancy thing that while it might be called sightstone its an item completely different than the current one and is not just going to be a trinket upgrade for everyone. Thats my point.

[–]coldize 5 points 14 days ago 
Again, I think you're misinterpreting.
They never insinuated that the trinket system is going to get new upgrade paths. Just that instead of paying 250g to upgrade your trinkets at level 9, those upgrades are free.
Sightstone is not likely to see crazy changes, but upgraded items that include sightstone and a gp/10 item most likely will.
My guess is items like Frostfang+sightstone to create a new t3 support item.
Or perhaps even something like Frost Queen's Claim + Ruby Sightstone, but that's less likely.

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
Yellow trinket is also getting 2 charges instead of 1, red trinket is getting new functionality, no mention of blue yet.
Sightstone will now have the option to combine with the Tier 2 Support items to be a sightstone with the T2 support item passives OR be a normal ruby sightstone with an additional 10% item CDR passive.

[–]Dmienduerst 0 points 14 days ago 
I think if your assuming that the current trinket system is enough to support warding needs of a team your wrong. There will be major changes to the trinkets I just think one of them on the yellow one is going to be a charge system like Sightstone.

[–]coldize 3 points 14 days ago 
The implication I got from the dev blog is that warding is too accessible now and teams that are ahead can simply blanket the map with wards and maintain a super safe and secure victory so they are adding another layer of warding limitation so that whether your team is ahead or behind, you both have access to a similar level of vision control.
It's like a follow-up to what they did in pre-season 4.
We'll have to wait to find out exactly what they have in store, though.

[–]Dmienduerst -1 points 14 days ago 
If they think that they are wrong imo. Teams can blanket on quadrant of the map completely or spread them out at key locations that are easily swept. The ward meta game currently is really healthy imo as it isn't smothering unless a team deserves that control with map pressure.

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
I just think one of them on the yellow one is going to be a charge system like Sightstone.
First off, already is. Secondly trinket upgrades are free now and yellow will start with 2 charges instead of 1.

[–]neenerpants -2 points 14 days ago 
This. It sounds like you can upgrade your trinket either into a Sight Stone OR an active item. And everyone on the team can do this.

[–]Ohaithurr92 8 points 14 days ago 
I think you may have misread the post, they are talking about the support items. Such as Nomad's Medallion instead of upgrading to Talisman, upgrades to a more powerful sightstone with some of the talisman qualities

[–]neenerpants 1 point 14 days ago 
Oh, you might be right actually. Hmm, I'm not sure I'd like that so much...

[–]Hashmir 0 points 14 days ago 
Just so we're on the same page:
Our goal with vision is two-fold: first, we want to keep pushing the vision game as a team effort and, second, we want to make vision more dynamic than days past.
For that first goal, we’re doing things like free trinket upgrades for all, along with the option for tier 2 support items to upgrade into either powerful tier 3 active items or slot-efficient sightstone upgrades.
And from Pwyff's comment up above:
Yellow trinket starts with 2 wards automatically.
Honestly, it all just depends on the final numbers. We'll have to see how powerful these sightstone upgrades are, and what we're giving up in the tier 3 support items.
At the moment, though, it sounds like you're not any worse off than before if you want to go [fully upgraded support item] + Sightstone + Sweeper -- you should be able to do it just like you can right now. Could be nice if want to start with Spellthief's but don't care about Frost Queen's Claim.

[–]Ohaithurr92 1 point 13 days ago 
I'd imagine it'd be a blend of the sightstone and the tier 3 support item.
Like, perhaps for Frost Queens, the stats are 50 ability power 10% cooldown reduction 50% mana regeneration and the active
Perhaps the upgraded sightstone would be something like 25 ability power 10% cooldown reduction 50% mana regeneration stores 4 wards Passive: Allows the placement of all 4 wards, increasing the Stealth Ward limit of the support to 4 instead of 3.

[–]hutre 3 points 14 days ago 
It sounds like sightstone is still a seperate thing but everyone get free upgraded trinkets. Also sightstone get alternative build paths!

[–]jacob_ninja_potato3 2 points 14 days ago 
I'm worried that I won't be able to ward river/tri pre-9, which would be awful

[–]FoleyX90 3 points 14 days ago 
Pink ward + trinket.

[–]Acomatico 1 point 14 days ago 
probably not deleted, as they said they were going to make better upgrades from the basic ss

[–]portugapt[Portugapt] (EU-W) 1 point 14 days ago 
I believe we will have a smaller version of sightstone for supports (and junglers) that upgrades into a better version over the course of the game, this way you can place wards early. Tho we may have to rely on a pink to do the job...

[–]Newthinker 1 point 14 days ago 
May see sight wards decrease in cost to make p for this
Either that or pack a single stealth ward with the 1:30 (or whatever it is at the moment) timer on it

[–]Cerestorn 1 point 14 days ago 
Free trinket upgrades.

[–]mb9023 1 point 14 days ago 
They only said removed stealth wards from the shop, not the game. So sight stones are more valuable, and also trinkets. But Pink Wards will be cheaper so you can buy that instead pre-9 if you need a second ward.
Expect to see more pink wards being purchased and trinket upgrades being more used.

[–]Llamalewis 1 point 14 days ago 
they previously mentioned that they are changing the build paths of sightstone, so just wait and see

[–]Dusty_Ideas 1 point 14 days ago 
I want Season 2 Support Vision Control back. I need to be able to compensate for the neglect...no, the utter CONTEMPT for vision control my team usually has.

[–]DatGrag 1 point 14 days ago 
Did you even read the post? Free trinket upgrades for everyone and yellow starts with 2 wards now.

[–]LionoofThundara 1 point 14 days ago 
Actually, what would happen is 2-3 players on the team would pick up sight stone, even if it doesn't have any good build paths for that specific champion. Vision is so massively important in League, that junglers are going to be almost required to grab a sight stone. Maybe even top laners would need to as the sightstone does give limited tank stats.

[–]SuperCharlesXYZ 1 point 13 days ago 
The supports have sightstones, but everybody gets 2 trinket charges at lvl 1 as far as I understand

[–]Muffiman 0 points 14 days ago 
The wards provided by one sightstone won't be enough. They want to push the item in directions where it can be bought by multiple roles (junglers already do that). At least thats what I think.

[–]fsychii 1 point 14 days ago 
bronze don't do that silly

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
Short answer: No.
Long answer: ...No. We're just removing the buyable green ward. Yellow Trinket has been significantly adjusted to compensate for the loss of wards - especially later in the game.

[–]IcemanHotty 1 point 13 days ago 
That's what I thought. Thanks for explaining.

[–]Aleknjo 1 point 14 days ago 
No, I don't think so. I think they just mean reoving green wards from the store. W'll still have trinkets and Sightstone. Likely they will be changed but I imagine the base functionality will stay.

[–]riri_md 1 point 14 days ago 
They said they're removing Stealth Wards from the shop. With the Sighstone changes, they're most likely going to be the only source for stealth wards.

[–]feedmaster 1 point 14 days ago 
And yellow trinkets. Buying sight wards in the shop was the least used way of warding anyway so this doesn't really change that much.

[–]Undrtakr991 1 point 14 days ago 
All they are doing is removing Green Wards from the store. Their rationale is that Green Wards arent really bought anymore, at all. Plus they take up an item slot.
You rarely ever see a laner or support go and buy a single green ward when they can just get a sightstone or pink ward and drop it in lane and lasts until someone notices it.
By dropping green wards in store, it just frees up space for newer stuff hopefully.
Sightstone and everything else will be there.

[–]arkhammer 1 point 14 days ago 
Well, they said removing stealth wards from the shop. Stealth wards will still exist from the yellow trinket and sight stones, presumably.

[–]XxBEASTYxXxKONG[No Peel] (NA) 1 point 14 days ago 
From what I understand they removed them from the shop but you can still place them with trinket/sightstone.

[–]C00kiz 1 point 14 days ago 
My guess is that they are just removing the stealth ward from the shop. Sightstones and trinkets will still drop them.

[–]KeeperArcanus 1 point 13 days ago

[–]Rohbo 1 point 13 days ago 
Pretty sure it says they're removed from the shop, and everything else indicates sight stone and trinkets are still available.
AKA if you don't buy upgraded yellow trinket or a sightstone, you can barely contribute to vision (vision denial, yea, but no jungler warding for laners to stop them being stupid unless you get sightstone).

[–]klethra 1 point 13 days ago 
Removed from the shop, not the game.

[–]AlexandreMTH 5 points 14 days ago 
"They finally removed those damn mana potions! I couldn't play anymore because of them, they made the game so unfair..."
For real though, doesn't removing mana pots favor Energy based champions or those that don't use mana whatsoever? How is this going to make the game more balanced? I don't understand the logic used here :/

[–]KbloeUIEOssa 4 points 14 days ago 
Tbh Energy midlaners and Kata are obsolete for a really long time and all midlane champs are mana users

[–]Lhivorde 2 points 14 days ago 
I'm fine with Kat being obsolete, to be honest. I'd give a couple of toes up to remove her from the game entirely.

[–]RiotXypherous 6 points 13 days ago 
Here's what mana potions actually did:
If you were a mana using champion - you:
Had 70 less gold to work with (because you had to buy two mana pots in order to sustain your costs.)
Your mana pool was smaller (because we assumed you would buy mana pots.)
The net result of this is that you typically have to dominate early in order to succeed - as there was no way you could sustain your costs if you were losing.
With the removal of pots - we've bumped up a lot of regeneration values or maximum mana pool of the characters who relied upon it .

[–]AlexandreMTH 1 point 13 days ago 
Now this clarifies a lot to me, thank you. It's great to see some of these more "polemic" (?) decisions explained a bit deeper.

[–]TheSneakySeal 1 point 14 days ago 
Most people don't buy mana pots. I can't remember the last time I've seen a mana pot bought in professional play.

[–]DatGrag 0 points 14 days ago 
Your logic, on the other hand, is flawless.

[–]AlexandreMTH 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm literally just trying to understand the resoning behind their decision. I never stated that my logic was perfect.

[–]DatGrag 2 points 13 days ago 
Because mana pots make mana champs harder to balance. It will be easier to adjust the mana regen of champs that are reliant on them than forcing them to buy mana pots and trying to somehow balance that. It won't make energy champs "more OP" because they are buffing the champs that rely on mana pots so they won't have to anymore.
Also, most champs don't even fucking buy mana pots. Also, they are trying to make flask more of a thing which has built in mana regen.

Preseason 2016 crests the horizon!

By Pwyff
Welcome to Preseason 2016. We’re trying to keep the conversation low-key for now with the Worlds final right around the corner but, with a pile of changes hitting the PBE soon, we wanted to get ahead with our gameplay goals for this preseason. After Worlds, you’ll hear more from other teams at Riot - with more than just gameplay! - but we’ll keep this focused on what changes will be hitting the PBE for this preseason and the upcoming 2016 season.
Let’s talk seasonal goals!
You may have already seen our early work with the ability power itemization changes in patch 5.13 to the juggernaut update in 5.16, but our goal for 2016 is to make each game of League of Legends feel unique. From the different champion strengths you bring, to the items you take to battle, all the way to the masteries you choose - we want your decisions to matter and have a clear impact on how each game plays out.
That said, this preseason we’re focusing on...
Updating Marksmen
Through the years, marksmen have lacked meaningful differences, with their identities typically centered on the same thing: do lots of damage from range. In cases like these, if you’re being judged on only one competition (damage), you get a pretty obvious power ranking with no real roster depth.
Our goal is similar to our work with juggernauts, where we targeted a group of champions (in this case six marksmen - Corki, Miss Fortune, Graves, Caitlyn, Kog’Maw, and Quinn) who occupied similar strategic spaces, and gave them a little more ‘uniqueness.’ We’re doing this in two ways: how the marksman plays, and how the team plays with them. For the first, since marksmen are so concerned with their basic attacks we want to make sure each feels different. Should you have brought that shotgun to a javelin battle? Maybe! For the second approach, we want to really push the breadth of what a marksman offers. Much like how you pick Ashe for global stuns, or Sivir for when you gotta go fast, or Miss Fortune when you need some wombo for your combo, we want teams to think different based on who’s joining the fray.
Marksmen Itemization
Hand-in-hand with the updates for marksmen, we’re bringing some deep changes to marksmen items like we did with ability power purchases and juggernaut gear.
When we first tackled AP items, we wanted to accommodate the mages who blow up squishies while also offering equal opportunities for those who control the battlefield. When it comes to attack damage items, however, marksmen will always be focused on what lets them deal the most damage at any given point in time. Knowing this, we're offering more options when it comes to who (or what) you want to fight, and how you contribute to your team through that choice. So whether you want to be a lone gunman, dueling on the edge of the fight, or the nimble spellcaster, or the siege machine and tower crusher, we’re providing you with the right items to buy so you can take out the right targets.
Keystone Masteries
We’re updating the mastery system to offer focused, high-impact choices rather than a slew of nuanced micro-math optimizations. Each mastery tree will have three tiers. Each successive tier you invest in, you’ll be able to pick up some stats and a choice of one of three potential masteries (you can only choose one!). Tier 1 masteries will be nice to have (but not game-changing), tier 2s will have a decent amount of strength, but tier 3s - we’re calling them “Keystone masteries” - will be the ones that really augment your playstyle. We’re still experimenting in this space, but an example would be a keystone mastery that lets your damaging abilities also bleed enemy champions for a portion of your bonus AD and AP over time. Or one that grants a movement speed boost the moment you deal a large chunk of damage to an enemy champion.
By condensing power into clear decision points, the masteries you take from game to game should have an impact on your playstyle, and we want to offer multiple mastery paths for most champions in League.
Vision & Support Items
Two seasons ago we did a major revamp of the vision system by introducing sightstones, trinkets, and ward limits. This season, we’re adding more options for those about to ward up (also: we salute you). Our goal with vision is two-fold: first, we want to keep pushing the vision game as a team effort and, second, we want to make vision more dynamic than days past.
For that first goal, we’re doing things like free trinket upgrades for all, along with the option for tier 2 support items to upgrade into either powerful tier 3 active items or slot-efficient sightstone upgrades.
For the second goal, we’re removing Stealth Wards from the shop so teams will need to rely more heavily on their pink (and blue trinket!) wards to get the vision control they need. In tandem with this change, however, we’re also adding a new feature in ward ‘debris’ when a ward passes on. By giving you the ability to see the dead bodies of wards who’ve moved on with their lives, you’ll be able to learn more about your opponent’s vision habits as well as your own.
Starting Items
In-hand with our goal to offer a diverse preseason, we decided to take a gander at starting items. When there are standard starting item builds for every game of League, the end result is these builds tend to benefit (very slightly) certain champions over others. We’re taking a different approach this preseason by offering more clear opening ‘paths’ so that players can refine their playstyles with real choices, rather than just opting for a generally powerful start. You’ll see these changes reflected in two sets of items: starting power items, and sustain.
For items you’re bringing to lane, we’re using the Doran’s set (blade, ring, and shield) as a baseline “generalist” group that provide all the broad stats you want. From there, we expanded your options to provide a few more ‘specialized’ approaches, like Cull - a light skirmishing AD starting item that provides less defensive stats than Doran’s Blade, but gives bonus gold for killing a set number of minions.
As for sustain items: we first started with health and mana potions. Health pots are going up in price to better position them as a purchase for those who just need some sustain to get them past the early game. Any form of long-term sustain we folded into the refillable potions (and their subsequent upgrades) to really solidify their identity (because before, it was… flask and potions to be a ‘sustain’ build). Mana potions, on the other hand, are being removed. Our decision to remove mana pots goes along the same philosophy as starting items. 100 mana tends to benefit certain types of champions over others (with mana costs being balanced against individual champion kits) and can wildly shift from being a mediocre purchase to a very cost-efficient one. By removing mana pots, we can better balance champion ability costs with the mana regeneration stat while also streamlining the ‘sustain game’ of League.
The Rift Herald
It’s no secret that players who depart for the top lane can end up feeling isolated without a dragon to contest. Rather than just flipping the map on its head, we’re exploring ways to bring some relevancy to the north so top laners can feel like they're interacting with their team before the 15 minute mark.
Details are still being sussed out, but expect to meet something new on Summoner’s Rift in the early phases of the game. Defeat it, and gain single target buff focused on early game power and pushing down the lane.
Wrapping Up...
We’ve got a few more changes on the way, but the above are some of our big gameplay plans for this preseason! That said, we’re not going to stop the conversation here. We’ll keep you updated on our progress while also sharing more of our long-term vision, so stay tuned after the World Finals for more on the preseason and 2016 season!

I'm so excited.The game will be revolutionary one more time.Preseason2015 here we come!!!

[–]GioMike 4 points 14 days ago 
every new season is like a new expansion of the game.

[–]Whisky-Toad 2 points 14 days ago 
Free trinket upgrades? I hope it auto places for you so my team will actually use theres!
Lol jk they just wouldnt buy one to start with then

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM TRY. MWAHAHAHA WE'LL GET YOU IN THE END.
I mean err.. there.. there are mechanisms in place if you should accidentally forgot to purchase your trinket... maybe.

[–]lonepenguin95 2 points 14 days ago 
Before everyone loses their shit they're not getting rid of wards, just moving them onto trinket and sightstone. You can still buy pink wards as well.

[–]Brutusness 2 points 14 days ago 
This is all very interesting, but on to more important matters: Is Swain getting something?

[–]jnxu 2 points 14 days ago 
What, the fuck

[–]maykarnFatMan 2 points 14 days ago 
Everyone is talking about Wards, and im over here like.. New monster in baron pit? COOL

[–]qtsupportgirl 2 points 14 days ago 
Are you taking into account past mana cost increases with the removal of Mana Pots? I totally agree that it's good for long-term balance considerations, but I'm worried that some champs like Zyra (who has cripplingly high early mana costs) had their numbers adjusted as a way of compensating for the presence of Mana Pots before, and are going to either have an incredibly hard early game without them or be shoehorned into picking up Flask every game.

[–]RiotXypherous 4 points 13 days ago 
The compensation adjustments for this change was relatively straightforward. We looked at every champion who bought 2 or more mana pots from our purchase data - and either gave them a starting boost of MP/5 or Max Mana, depending on their class.
Supports / Utility Mages got an MP/5 boost - while ADC/Fighter types got some of their mana growth moved into their starting mana pool so they have a much higher starting mana pool.

[–]qtsupportgirl 2 points 13 days ago 
That's a really smart way of going about it. Thanks for all your hard work!

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
If you get a chance on PBE to try stuff out - pick up some champions and see if you still feel mana constrained.
There's a real risk that we'll have to do further work on mana and mana regeneration or more compensation.

[–]isitaspider2 1 point 13 days ago 
My question is about champions with really oppressive early games that are only gated by mana costs (Pantheon/Yorick are the big two). The only good thing about the situation was that they had to sink a lot of money into mana pots and mana regen to keep up their harass. If they get a free mana pool increase, then won't that make their early game even more oppressive as they won't have to pay for that offensive power now as it's free through the mana pool increase and they can spend this money elsewhere, like on a flask for even more ability spam or in getting more early game damage?

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
It has a very real risk of what you're saying - that temporarily Pantheon's lane harass will go out of control.
However, the fact that a continuous gold sink exists on a character means that they need to win hard to be relevant - so when the character is at a 'balanced' win rate - they'll always feel oppressive.
Put another way - there's no way they can tie if they have a continuous gold sink to stay relevant in lane and therefore, they either feel oppressive or useless.

[–]MelcorScarr 1 point 13 days ago 
Didn't you normalize the MP/5 with the Stat Overhaul a year ago or so? Are you partially "reverting" that normalization now?

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
Yes - although the purpose of normalization tends to lead to immediate reverts of the items involved.
This is because, every so often - you change some rules and bring things back into some sort of baseline and then you need to adjust because you need to solve edges.
It's kind of like pruning - you know there's some organic growth - you need to prune it to a more understandable state - then do the minimum required to get it to a functional state.

[–]MelcorScarr 2 points 12 days ago 
Thank you for the explanation! :) Ah, and... you really did a good job this pre-preseason hyping everyone. Keep it up and good luck! :)

[–]RimeSkeem 2 points 13 days ago 
Pwyff said they had Xypherous go through all the mana champions and adjust accordingly. Take that as you will.

[–]Sacavain 1 point 14 days ago 
Their reason is complete BS. It'll allow us to be sure some champs dont benefits too much from it (meanwhile the energy based or manaless champs are laughing) (or almost all recent champs that don't require any mana management because their spell costs 20 mana).

[–]FoleyX90 1 point 14 days ago 
who has cripplingly high early mana costs
She also has a level 1 skill that can root multiple people. She's fine.

[–]callmealfred 2 points 14 days ago

[–]ThisOneTimeAtLolCamp 2 points 13 days ago 
Well that's one way to fix the vision bugs I guess...

[–]Gdubdubdub 2 points 13 days ago 
How will warding be more of a team effort by removing warding tools exactly???

[–]Bycraft 1 point 13 days ago 
Free trinket upgrades and better sight-stone + they clearly want more pink wards.

[–]Gdubdubdub 1 point 13 days ago 
So trinket upgrade is level 9, sightstone is a niche item for supports plus some junglers and pink wards are capped at 1. If they up the cap then great, where are the stealth wards they are many to be detecting coming from? Also rip evelynn

[–]Bycraft 1 point 13 days ago 
Apparently there will be 3 jungle item paths. Stalkers, challenging smite and re charging sightstone thing with 2 wards

[–]thegoatsareback 1 point 13 days ago 
Stealth wards are being removed from the shop, not the game. iirc yellow trinket has two charges now and automatically upgrades for free. There's no need for an item in the shop if you have access to that item all the time.

[–]-Cerastes-[Snake on bush] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
Because now people need to decide who's going for Sweeper and who's going for Totem (and for the Orb) ... instead of pretty much everybody going for Sweeper and buying green wards like we have now.
(in Competitive games mostly)

[–]MonfooEuw 2 points 13 days ago 
I am using mana pots as adc ( caitlyn, ezreal ) to win lane. U can't forget that not only mages uses mana pots and it will hit some players playstyle without compensation on regeneration...

[–]DontDoDrugss 2 points 13 days ago 
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KEEP MY ADC SAFE PLAYING LULU WITH NO MANA POTS?! THIS IS SUICIDAL!!!1111!!1

[–]RiotXypherous 5 points 13 days ago 
WITH YOUR INCREASED BASE MANA REGENERATION AND INCREASED MANA REGENERATION ON FROSTFANG AND FROST QUEEN'S CLAIM.
I mean... err.. we took a look at people who bought 2 or more mana potions and did some base mana or base mana regeneration compensation.

[–]DontDoDrugss 1 point 13 days ago 
Oh, ok, that sounds awesome, I can use the 95 gold for something else now, like...uh...more health pots!!! Yayyyyy!!11111111111!!1

[–]herbye53 1 point 13 days ago 
Did you at all read the part where they say this opens up champions to be more balance-able in terms of mana? They are likely to increase the base mana regen and mana regen on most items if they're removing the mana pots.

[–]HiImSoRandom(EU-NE) 2 points 13 days ago 
TRIST OUTRANGING TURRETS

WE DOTA NOW

[–]herbye53 1 point 13 days ago 
Tristana has always outranged turrets at 18 I thought.

[–]Nadaar(NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
No, she's like, JUST within range at 18 at I think.

[–]S4mmiches 2 points 13 days ago* 
Recall her having 669 (703 pre-rework?) range at 18, turrets have 775.
Edit: Correcting values.

[–]deltaz420Change wasnt good 2 points 13 days ago 
So they are basically fucking us junglers up, again if the health pot prices go up and we get no compensation for it, since its already hard to get level 3 on some champs.

[–]4x1t 2 points 13 days ago 
I'm worried ;_;
Really hope they don't kill the AP Maw in the process of those changes

[–]CSDragon[CSDragon] (NA) 2 points 13 days ago

[–]IAmInside 2 points 13 days ago 
All of these semi-teasing reveals hurts me. I NEED TO KNOW THE FULL CHANGES NOW. I can't stand this.

[–]Diostukos(NA) 2 points 13 days ago 
Tier 2 support item + Sightstone = an upgraded Sightstone with upgraded stats from both component items.
E.g. Frost Fang + Sightstone combine into 'Eye of the Watchers' which has the Sightstone ward active, the Tribute passive and gives Health/AP/GP10/Mana Regen.
My body is so ready

[–]MisterOpioid 2 points 13 days ago 
We are getting rid of mana and health potions and replacing them with these!!!

[–]Unlucky_Whale 1 point 13 days ago 
As a support main I'm extremely happy with these changes and can't wait for them to go live.

[–]Erid0s 2 points 13 days ago 
If there will be no more green wards, but sightstone still, isn't it secret buff for Lee Sin as pro players will naturally want more vision?

[–]JudasLover 1 point 13 days ago

[–]DJSonaSucks 3 points 13 days ago* 
It is time for the "you read there first" on Reddit.
Our goal is similar to our work with juggernauts, where we targeted a group of champions (in this case six marksmen - Corki, Miss Fortune, Graves, Caitlyn, Kog’Maw, and Quinn) who occupied similar strategic spaces, and gave them a little more ‘uniqueness.’
They will mess up some of them really hard and they will start to be used in midlane, crushing a lot of casters.
Or one that grants a movement speed boost the moment you deal a large chunk of damage to an enemy champion.
Get ready for everyone to have an impossible to balance Jinx's passive/Ahri's Q passive.
Knowing this, we're offering more options when it comes to who (or what) you want to fight, and how you contribute to your team through that choice.
Like how they made the Luden's Echo for poke Champ but it is so fucking good that every mage builds it?
There always will be a better choice anyway.
Cull - a light skirmishing AD starting item that provides less defensive stats than Doran’s Blade, but gives bonus gold for killing a set number of minions.
Will be 100% picked over Doran's Blade.
we can better balance champion ability costs with the mana regeneration stat
They won't. There will be mana issues and complains for months.
Details are still being sussed out, but expect to meet something new on Summoner’s Rift in the early phases of the game. Defeat it, and gain single target buff focused on early game power and pushing down the lane.
This will lead to Smite on toplaners (with the subsequential abuse of jungle items by laners) and 1vs1 toplaners skirmishes to control the new monster. Also, the new buff will make the toplane even more unbalanced because it will favor early game and snowball Champions, and a toplaner with a lead can easily control the monster better, get the buff and get a wider and wider lead, while the opponent would have even worse time recovering from a bad lane.

[–]Alteffour 2 points 13 days ago 
just a comment on your last point about the new buff and early game toplaners: this is assuming that only the top laners will concentrate on that buff and the rest of the teams completely ignore it. what's to say junglers and mid laners won't get involved? and since globals are so powerful right now, why wouldn't the players with globals use them to try and grab that buff post lvl 6? just playing devil's advocate here. i think you're right pre level 6 if junglers completely ignore top. i also think between having this new buff and having marksmen kits and items reworked, it's really going to force teams - and junglers in particular - to chose between getting your top lane that buff or getting your newly reworked ad marksman ahead.

[–]smitteh 1 point 13 days ago 
Waaah waah changes bad waaaah

[–]DXCharger 2 points 14 days ago 
The header picture for the marksmen changes shows what looks like new abilities for Quinn and Graves.

[–]fankifalfur(EUNE) 2 points 14 days ago 
Mostly good stuff here. I don't have an opinion on the mini Baron and ward removal, just seems weird to comprehend right now.
Can't wait!

[–]BrotherIshmael 2 points 14 days ago 
"Removing mana pots" So riot... PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GIVE GALIO MANA BUFFS. I swear he's more forgotten than yorick. At least they acknowledge that they hate him. Galio is that kid who is naturally strong and buff but has asthma so he can't reach his full potential.

[–]Raxerbou 1 point 14 days ago 
"More forgotten than yorick" Yorick needs mana pots more than galio currently

[–]stikkyikkysneaky jew 1 point 14 days ago 
"More forgotten than yorick" nonsense. galio got the whole ult chance in 5.12(idk if it was a buff or nerf i dont play galio) and even a small change 2 patches ago in 5.18 and before that near the end of S4. yorick got last touched in patch 5.6 and before that a nerf in 4.2 and then(not counting a change to him on crystal scar only) all the way back in preseason 3.

[–]KanchiHaruhara[That may be contagious] (EU-W) 1 point 14 days ago 
She didn't get reworked, just some "tweaks" (I've heard it ended up being more of a nerf than anything, but I can't say as I haven't been playing lately).

[–]jacob_ninja_potato3 1 point 14 days ago 
She got an ad ratio on her ult, I've seen it oneshot people

[–]farenknight[Axeleration] (EU-W) 1 point 14 days ago 
Yep but they announced a rework after the BILGEWATER event

[–]Pobeltme 2 points 14 days ago 
So, remove starting item diversity and force everyone to go a certain path, then remove wards to reward players who can't ward. This is such an idiotic change.

[–]Specter1138[Specter 1138] (NA) 2 points 14 days ago* 
What the actual fuck. My precious vision. I can't even. I don't like change!!! I silently disagree almost always with Riot usually, but then i give it time to see if I feel the same later, and I usually don't. But this, this will take some getting used to...
Edit: And the enemy can see where we like to ward, yeah...

[–]ViciousSkittle 3 points 14 days ago 
Not a single detail has been announced, better start complaining :^)

[–]porofix 3 points 14 days ago 
Too early to judge. waaaaaaaaay too early

[–]Specter1138[Specter 1138] (NA) 1 point 14 days ago 
I know, just that this preliminary stuff changes the dynamic of the vision game which is really cool/interesting and unknown at the same time, because I don't know where it's headed but I'm with Riot on this Magical Journey!

[–]feedmaster 1 point 14 days ago 
So, the only way you're warding is with buying sight wards? I don't even buy a sight ward in every game. Removing them from the shop won't change almost anything.

[–]Specter1138[Specter 1138] (NA) 1 point 14 days ago 
Well, myself personally I like to have a sweeper and clean vision so I do buy a fair amount of green wards. I believe in the power of vision denial and the randomness of people in solo queue.

[–]feedmaster 1 point 14 days ago 
Which just means you'll buy sightstone instead. I mean, even now sightstone is a lot more efficient than just buying a lot of wards.

[–]ProbablyAPun 2 points 14 days ago 
Problem being that sightstone delays your power. Spending 75/150g every once in awhile doesn't heavily delay your build. Spending 800g upfront for your wards does though.

[–]feedmaster 1 point 14 days ago 
I don't see a problem. Sightstone is a really gold efficient itme. It's already mandatory on junglers in competitive play. With junglers and supports buying sightstone, having upgraded yellow trinket will be more than enough.

[–]M_Zoon 1 point 14 days ago 
I really like this. It makes vision control much more interactive!

[–]Hashmir 1 point 14 days ago 
They're giving free ward upgrades and the starting yellow trinket gives 2 wards now, plus pink wards are cheaper. All indications are that Riot is working towards having more and easier vision, so I wouldn't panic just yet.

[–]SenaIkaza 1 point 14 days ago 
...I was really hoping for a move back towards normalizing wards as just normal items and removing the limit of wards per person, or at least raising it. And now it sounds like they're making them even more weird to use. Really not excited about this change at all.

[–]AkuraJebia[AvB Akura] (EU-W) 2 points 14 days ago 
I know that these changes are still highly experimental but I really hope they don't go through with removing green wards from the shop.
It just seems like something that would really dumb down the game, since they also mentioned free trinket upgrades, I reckon that they kind of want to replace green wards with Sighstone/Trinket completely.
It just more or less removes the option to snowball/have a better setup around objectives by buying more wards than the opponent, now everyone would have the same amount without even having to spend money, assuming that that's the direction that Riot wants to go with these changes.

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
There are multiple sources to spend money on wards on - Sightstones - their upgrades and a potential gold sink in the Jungle.
Ultimately though, I'd like the vision game to move towards you using your limited resources well - rather than it being a resource tradeoff of how much gold I can sink into the system. The ultimate goal is to move towards a space where the vision system is more 'Spy Tool A vs. Spy Tool B' than 'Economics and Resource Distribution.'
Basically, the skill that we're trying to test for isn't gold economy (as I think the item system and your item choices should be about that) - but whether or not you can use your limited wards effectively and whether or not you can infer the warding patterns of your opponents from their behavior (and other markers like ward debris.)

[–]AkuraJebia[AvB Akura] (EU-W) 1 point 14 days ago 
Hmm, thanks for clearing that up, I certainly understand some of the thought process behind it better now.
The main problem that I, personally, still have with this concept is that it limits the player's choices, which is investing into vision or not, in some way. And then of course also the amount that someone wants to invest. Of course, I'm just basing all of this on the very little amount of information that we got so far, but that's kind of the vibe that I got from the initial statement.
With this trinket system, you're kind of just given these resources for free instead of actively making a decision whether to opt into them or not by buying additional wards. For me, it was just always one way to gain a direct advantage over my enemy that didn't evolve a direct strategical or mechanical outplay. Just buying more wards than your opponent was also a way to get an advantage or snowball one if you couldn't do the aforementioned things.

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
I agree with you that it limits the players choices about how to invest their gold - that's actually the intent - so you're totally justified to feel irked in this manner.
Unfortunately - what we've found is that for a system like vision - the appropriate amount of resources to invest into vision is 'as much as you can' and so it isn't really a great of a decision tree as it first seemed.
Apologies - I can definitely see why it would bother you and you're totally justified in feeling that way - it's just not a path that we're willing to maintain or support given the costs it has on other systems. :x

[–]AkuraJebia[AvB Akura] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
It's fine really, I'm sure you guys will do a great job no matter what you end up deciding to do! :p
I'm still pretty stoked about all these changes and I'm certain it'll work out for the better.

[–]Nilinor 2 points 13 days ago 
They did mention the trinket wards now have 2 charges as well, and people still use pinks, thats just the STARTING trinket wards, when upgraded probably have more uses, such as lasting the full duration, but the trinket having 60-90 cd, so you can still use all 3 wards and a pink ward.
Its not really dumbing down, I see it more of a QOL change. If anything it will make late game more interesting when you have no slots for wards, at least you will still have something to stick down instead of just having a completely dark minimap.

[–]InTheAbsenceofTrvthKappaPride 1 point 14 days ago 
I wonder how the new trinkets will affect ganking junglers. Cuz we all know that Riot doesn't like it when junglers can change the outcome of lanes.

Nope. That item will probably never see the light of day in that form. I'm not exactly sure where to go with it, to be honest - there's a lot of problems and player pain surrounding it.

[–]Nilinor 1 point 14 days ago 
My guess, is that it was a test for the experimental blue trinket ward they were making.

Also, why rework Kog'Maw? He seems super healthy right now, in fact he's very well balanced and has a unique playstyle (utter immobility and zero self peel in exchange for huge range and DPS)

[–]FoleyX90 1 point 14 days ago 
I don't hate the vision changes. At least in my ELO (low gold) nobody buys vision wards anyway. Bonus though I won't have to beg everyone to spend 250gold to upgrade their trinket.

[–]AsceLoL 1 point 14 days ago 
I like everything but the vision changes. I don't get why they decided to remove Stealth Wards.

[–]linkchomp 1 point 14 days ago 
Because they want to push trinkets that so many people do not use and increase the vision battle aspect not just place a ward in a very likely expected spot at a fairly expected point in time with very readable play around it.
Cheaper pinks to hopefully push people to actually buy them and place them well.

[–]gniman 1 point 14 days ago 
So do we panic yet?

[–]shadowbyron 1 point 14 days ago 
These changes look REALLY interesting. The top lane objective and removal of purchasable wards. I think its gonna be refreshing.
One thing I find really interesting is the new objective they have on top side. Would be really cool to see how they're gonna pull that off

[–]Dark512 1 point 14 days ago 
As long as Morde doesn't make that his bitch too, I think I'll be ok with it. Looking at what they wrote, with the single buff pushing power, it'll be "kill top, rotate to herald with jungles, take buff, rotate top/mid, take turret"

[–]shadowbyron 1 point 13 days ago 
Hopefully not. Either way, it should be pretty cool how pro play might evolve with a new objective at the top side of the map. Maybe permanently sending adc/supp top side, dbl jungling with top laner, then 4 manning the herald and zerging top. It just opened up so many possibilites

[–]Killerchark 1 point 14 days ago 
No more mana pots? RIP blitzcrank. Also, if stealth wards are removed unless you buy a SS, supports are going back to being ward bots.

[–]azwelf 1 point 14 days ago 
The 3 ward restriction is still there so i don't think that will be likely

[–]linkchomp 1 point 14 days ago 
They are adjusting mana and mana regen stats.
No they aren't. They are still limited by Ward count. A lot of players still barely use trinkets (which will upgrade for free, automatically) or buy wards, with the most impactful wards from other players being Pink in many cases (which will have reduced cost). When they do it's often 1-2 Wards, including the pink per game. Why is top/mid/jungle not lit up and the enemy seems to run through their constantly? Because people still refuse to play the vision game.
Wards are highly predictable and still will be, but not always easy to clean out, mostly due to lack of Pinks and Trinket usage. This actually pushes the vision mini-game a bit more. You want vision? Buy a pink. You want to keep that vision? Be ready to protect it. Now a Jungler isn't sitting in a bush of a key ward spot waiting to go in because they aren't paying attention/muted players who are telling them there is a ward there while the enemy sits themselves in a situation not to push up. Still see this in Gold / Plat.

[–]Mirkkatje 1 point 14 days ago 
Stealth wards will be removed from the shop, BUT yellow trinket stay and they get automatically (?) upgraded for free at lvl 9, starting at 2 wards immediately.
People will just have to buy pinks (which will be cheaper) instead of stealth wards in addition to their trinket wards. I don't see how this is going to change anything for support, except for the better when people get those trinket upgrades for free.

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
Yellow trinkets actually just get continuously better from level 1 to 18 rather than at 9 - to try to smooth out lanes a bit better.

[–]Mirkkatje 1 point 13 days ago

IM GETTING HYPED

[–]barnabi 1 point 14 days ago 
Removing Mana potions is such a stupid idea. There are some older champs that NEED those in the early game, because of their outdated mana costs. And now they have to spend more gold(or runes/masteries) on being able to simply use their abilities?

[–]GioMike 2 points 14 days ago 
they can simply change the mana costs.

[–]RiotXypherous 0 points 14 days ago 
We looked at every champion who bought 2 or more mana pots per game and gave them either increased early regeneration or increased early mana pool to compensate for this.
While it is highly likely that we'll still want some abilities to be gated heavily by Mana costs - there were ~30+ or so champions that received bumps in their mana pools or regeneration.

[–]0ffbeat 1 point 14 days ago

But I would love to see at the end of the game the whole map with the broken ground and broken terrain

But most importantly, FREE FUCKING TRINKET UPGRADES! STOP BEING SHITTERS, YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE ANYMORE!

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
Actually - it's not even just that it's free. It's just automatic by character level.
They literally cannot have a non-upgraded yellow in their inventory by the end-game. They'd have to deliberately sell it.

[–]LoZfan03 1 point 13 days ago 
what's happening to the pink ward upgrade for yellow trinket? removed? separated into its own trinket?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
It's removed.

[–]Gilox 1 point 13 days ago 
Wait, are you saying you can get full gold value for selling the upgraded trinket by endgame? $$$

[–]jzuo 1 point 14 days ago 
So many changes coming, these and more, plus the new champion select. I love it

[–]UnemployedDog 1 point 14 days ago 
ADC changes were to be expected since the bruiser rework means adc's had to be reworked to deal with them.
Starting itemization changes are fair, the new baron thing is weird but fair. Removing mana pots is alright, they're not bought very often and it may open them up to finally upping base mana regen on most champs.
But removing pink wards is going to be a problem. Last time they changed pink wards they ended up vastly buffing stealth champs, removing them altogether is such a disgusting buff to evelynn/rengar that I hope they know what they're doing. And before someone brings it up, yes I realize pink ward trinket will probably stay, but if it's gated by level 9 it's worthless. Not to mention most roles won't want to take it anyways as they now have to give up their warding trinket just to survive stealthers.
Dangerous stuff, hope they play test it a lot before pushing it to live. Also ends up buffing the already very powerful wraith smite making it almost a must if ganking bot, as your bot lane won't be able to prep you with pinks anymore.

[–]Roseking 2 points 14 days ago 
They are not removing vision (pink) wards.
They are removing stealth (green) wards.

[–]FDSariku 1 point 14 days ago 
Pink wards stay, green wards leave.

[–]Lotfa 1 point 14 days ago* 
No green wards? I wonder how that will affect competitive play, since we just saw certain teams from a certain region outward and out play their semifinal opponents.
Only thing I remember off the top of my head was one of the casters prior to the SKT-OG series said that Origen placed the fewest wards before the 15 minute mark.

Think my biggest fear is if the Herald does give 1 person Baron buff then it will most likely go to the mid laner to hard push instead of the top laner. Baron minions immune to magi damage would be so cancerous early on in the game.

[–]Meon1845(EU-NE) 1 point 14 days ago 
I've been maining Quinn for 2 years and I've never been more ready to see her picked up by Valor and carried around.

[–]Ayway2long 1 point 14 days ago 
How are laners supposed to escape ganks now, with only ONE trinket ward that is available every 120 seconds for 60 seconds?
And does this mean only Nunu, Lee Sin, and others like them will be the only junglers played now? Sightstone just became a MUST-have for junglers.
I'm confused, why would they do this....

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
Yellow trinket has been heavily altered to account for the removal of sight wards - also, pink wards are 75 G.
While neither of these on its own will replace the power of green wards - they provide some early safety to cover lane needs.

[–]Ayway2long 1 point 13 days ago 
But can summoners still place more than 1 sightward early game like before? If they can't, how about do something like: Pay a certain amount of gold to unlock greater trinket totem for multiple wards prior to level 9, and those who do not pay for it get it at level 9 as usual? :s just wondering if that'd be a good addition.

[–]k1ckkiller12 1 point 14 days ago

[–]Vintrial 1 point 14 days ago

[–]DarthValerEU shall not pass! 1 point 14 days ago 
They said they want to make Sightstone a purchase appealing mainly to supports.

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
They'll probably be quite strong. There will be a Jungle Item that intrinsically provides wards so that you don't have to be strong enough to take an 800 GP early game 'tax' to have access to them.

[–]hashinshin 1 point 14 days ago 
How much damagecreep can league sustain before it simply doesn't become satisfying anymore?

[–]Kirea 1 point 14 days ago 
Competitively I could see junglers who can use sightstone effectively becomming meta. Furthermore if the buff from that the baron lite monster provides is any good, then teleport could be a less desirable summoner.

[–]Standupaddict 1 point 14 days ago 
I'm happy that they are reworking the vision items. I think right now its way to easy to grab and improved yellow trinket and dump wards thoughtlessly around the map. I'm assuming they are going to curb yellow trinket's power or buff red trinket. The removal of green wards forces players to make a decision whether they want to remove vision or create vision.

[–]hellschatt 1 point 14 days ago 
My reaction.

[–]Archonath 1 point 14 days ago 
Seems like they have reworked Quinn where her Ultimate (I'm guessing) is her getting carried by Valor. Interesting

[–]Dotbgm 1 point 14 days ago 
Question regarding the Keystone Masteries. Does that replace the current Talent/Mastery trees or just be an addition to what we currently have? It sounds a lot like the system that is currently in World of Warcraft, where you chose a tier and have very limited picks. In my personal opinion, the new talents are not working in Warcraft, so I hope Riot won't implement a similar system.

[–]M_Zoon 1 point 14 days ago

[–]Ram090 1 point 14 days ago 
the option for tier 2 support items to upgrade into either powerful tier 3 active items or slot-efficient sightstone upgrades.
I think I know what upgrade we will be forced to buy...
Here's hoping we truly have a choice in that regard.

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
Internally, the tier 3 active items probably still win out if you like active items. If you hate the tier 3 actives - the slot-efficient SS's make more sense for you - because you get to buy the other items.
From rough internal thoughts - what it comes down to is that more traditional supports will probably favor the tier 3 actives - while less traditional supports (Brand, et al) will probably favor the slot-efficient ones.
It comes down to how much you like actives / how much you can use them vs. how much you like having an extra item slot for more traditional builds.

[–]BUfels 1 point 14 days ago

[–]Sacavain 1 point 14 days ago 
Honestly, I'm not so confident about that. With how much Riot seems to hate this role, we may totally end up with small gimmicky reworks that wont adress any issues of the champions concerned but will just destroy some fun aspects they have. Let's see what they got.

[–]gtjio[Hugify Your Tilt] (NA) 1 point 14 days ago 
slot-efficient sightstone upgrades
Okay I play a good amount of support and I personally don't like this change. Unless these upgrades cannot be purchased until like level 9 or 13 or something, supports will just rush them and once again become ward-bots :\

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 14 days ago 
But every reasonably good support rushes Sightstone already. They're giving supports the CHOICE they deserve.

[–]gtjio[Hugify Your Tilt] (NA) 1 point 14 days ago 
This is true, yes, but if these choices make the item slot-efficient, then there would be no reason for supports to first-buy anything other than the sightstone upgrade. This shoehorns them into being ward-bots rather than picking up different support items to fill unique roles/niches (Ex: Aegis against AP heavy teams, Zeke's to help snowball your ADC, etc)

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 13 days ago 
Not at all. While the passive on Sightstone is awesome, it is basicaly a Ruby Crystal worth of status. Now imagine an upgrade for it that gives you enhanced movement speed for X seconds after placing a ward. That would make the item more slot efficient, but are you sure that would be worth rushing? Imagine an upgrade that you could make with Bami's Cinder, that gives you that aura. Would be useless to squishy supports like Sona, Nami, Annie, but would make the slot very efficient with Leona, Braum, Tahm. And still, not mandatory. Imagine an upgrade that make your wards show enemy Stealth Wards for 5 seconds, when placed. There's a lot of options that doesn't break the item and, still, makes it more slot efficient.

[–]LaserLOL 1 point 14 days ago 
The only thing i absolutely hated was the removal of mana pots. Their resoning for the said it's one of the most senseless shit i've ever read.
But it's preseason anyway, let's see.

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 14 days ago 
Basically, mana potions created this effect:
Oh man, this character spams X skill in lane. Okay, we'll try to increase the mana cost of that ability.
Oh wait - now they just buy mana potions and they must dominate their lane early - otherwise they've just completely lost the lane early. If they don't win - now they're down the cost of pots and still can't cast their spells.
Most players feel like their character is absolutely garbage as they can't cast spells.
Competitive players snowball the hell out of the character or abandon them entirely.
Conclusion: I'm not sure how mana potions are actually helping us out here. Let's just have like... some sort of reasonable mana pool expectations that we can actually tune around.

[–]Mangea 1 point 14 days ago 
Potions have for a long time been very a overlooked part of LoL and part of why new players might have trouble getting into the game.
Cheap potions do not appeal to many of these new players, as they are consumable and does not grant big, juicy numbers (coupled with pictures of blooddripping swords).
Quite frankly, potions are overpowered as hell, considering a Health Potion, worth 35 gold, grants as much health as a Ruby Crystal, costing 400 gold.
By just buying a nice stack of potions and wards instead of another Long Sword, Amp Tome, one can really make a difference.
I just remembered back when potions stacked to 13. I won 8 games in a row with Mordekaiser. ;)
Anyways, I'm glad that Riot are looking into this. Removing mana potions was really out of the blue, but it's an interesting change, for sure.

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 14 days ago 
Removing mana potions was really out of the blue
I see what you did there.

[–]Shane4894 1 point 14 days ago 
So with the wards, you still get wards (green ones) from sightstone / trinkets that last 3 minutes, but you can't buy them individually from the store?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
Yes.

[–]Golden_Kumquat[Golden Kumquat] (NA) 1 point 14 days ago 
Speculation, but an ADC item that increases attack range? I'm just judging by the Tristana outranging the tower.

[–]Roonskape 1 point 14 days ago 
Do they also mean the (upgraded) yellow trinket with ''removing stealth wards'' ?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
Nope - just the buyable green wards.

[–]Filipe_Aguiar 1 point 14 days ago 
They're removing Stealth Wards from the shop. Not from the game.

[–]Slaughterknight[Slaughterknight] (NA) 1 point 14 days ago 
Seems like pink wards are going to be the next big thing for vision. I wonder how this is going to affect gank heavy junglers especially seeing how there is another objective on the map.

[–]hmmvitamins 1 point 14 days ago 
I really hope that upgrading trinkets is possible earlier in the game.
Only 1 short-timed ward after my first jungle clear....scary thought.

The yellow trinket (at base) can store up to two charges and continuously improves with your champion level.
You can't upgrade it earlier - it just keeps getting better with every level you have and starts out being able to store 2 charges.

[–]Kezmark 0 points 14 days ago 
She is strong ... in lane, but if you don't get a good enough lead and play smart you're gonna be fucked. Basically she's not worth the risk. She can also be a shit early pick since she can get countered by some if they know she goes top + she's most effective to pick as a hard counter, so good luck getting top as 4th-5th pick, it almost never happens and those are the reasons you don't see her often if at all.

"By removing mana pots, we can better balance champion ability costs with the mana regeneration stat" Except there is no way they are going through every old champ to modernize their mana costs. Sounds like a straight nerf to champs released prior to season 2 or 3

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
You're right that I didn't go through every old champion to modernize their mana costs. That would come later.
What we did do is look at every champion who bought mana pots frequently (2 or more in a game) and adjusted their base mana pool or regeneration up.

[–]Shane4894 1 point 14 days ago 
As an avid Fiddlesticks player (yah, even after they removed Magus for .... shit whatever the new AP items called) I rely heavily on mana pots - especially as I stop at the upgraded smite without going for ... RUNEGLAIVE as you rarely aa with Fiddle and need Zhonyas straight away. I mean if i donate blue to my mid laner, I better get a lot of extra mana / mana regen.

[–]nocowsallowed 1 point 14 days ago 
Wouldn't the duo lane just go top lane instead because of the Rift Herald? Depending on the duration and strength of the buff, they could snowball the game through brute force pushing. Maybe to the point that dragon and the Aspect buff wouldn't even be relevant.
Also, put it on your AD and they'll have an earlier (temporary) powerspike. The itemization changes may also have an impact.

[–]iwishiwasEtho 1 point 14 days ago 
I wonder, the Rift Herald might be a bigger change than it seems, depending on how strong it is/its buff is. The entire meta of 1/1/1/2 is based around having the ADC and supp in bot so they have extra dragon pressure with 2 members. It says the buff is isngle target, and it won't be as impactful as baron or stacking dragon in the long run, but I could see some teamcomps that would prefer pressuring the Rift Herald instead. It might open up the meta for more options.

Why do people sound confused about the removal of purchasable/consumable stealth wards? The yellow trinket is going to remain and still be a stealth wards....they're just trying to funnel the direction into purchasing pinks.

[–]Ehler 1 point 14 days ago 
I hope this is really tested.
Yellow trinkets starting with 2 charges + No green wards mean Junglers are straight up fucked since everything will be most likely covered since minute 0 and forced into sightstone more than ever.

[–]Sacavain 1 point 14 days ago 
I'm super scared at what they will do to corki. Most nerfs they did to him were quite horrible to play with. When they changed his Q before it had an AD ratio; when the cd between missiles went up; when valkyrie got its manacost doubled meaning that if you use it once early in the lane you wont play agressive. They had to nerf him, absolutely. But they always did in a way that was seriously diminishing the fun to play the champ. So please Rito, be nice to corki.

[–]theevilscientist 1 point 14 days ago 
I personally like these changes - as someone who regularly uses his trinket wards, and upgrades ASAP. I also buy picks semi-regularly so it definitely benefits me. It doesn't discourage vision - it actually encourages it IMO.

Well I don't like any of the ideas proposed. I'm worried about these broad sweeping changes on an old and stagnating player base. If it doesn't come out smooth and sucks then I imagine a lot more people will try over watch and hero's of the storm. I hope it comes out nice though. Losing green wards : ( Losing mana pots : ( Specializing adcs when generalized utility is what wins games in league. (Idea being the more specialized your champ is the less you have to offer in general) New adc items that one can only assume will more greatly affect the top lane meta than the bot lane. And lastly a new buff to snowball the new carry lane (top) even more. Sounds like a crap shoot that I am not looking forward to. Maybe it'll all work out though.

Remember, stronger, not strongest.

[–]WssDrBlue 1 point 14 days ago 
Initial thoughts and guesses about marksman changes:
1) In what universe does kogmaw and quinn occupy the SAME strategic space? (currently I feel that all the mentioned marksmen allready occupy different strategic choices, maybe excluding graves/lucian who are quite similar). I get what they are aiming at tho.
2) "Knowing this, we're offering more options when it comes to who (or what) you want to fight, and how you contribute to your team through that choice." New minigame: "bet on who on ur team is gonna be dumpstered in lane so you know what to itemize against" . In seriousness tho I expect this will end up in 3 choices, the lategame hypercarry frontline destructo build (attackspeed,crit, pen), the ad caster build (CDR flat damage, sprinkled with pen), and some new turret pusher item (for the fastpush trist/cait ish). In soloq I think this will keep making the hypercarries the valid choice, unless they significantly buff the base stats of the casters (graves, luc, corki).
3) "For the first, since marksmen are so concerned with their basic attacks we want to make sure each feels different" new attack animations, this is gonna be brutal to relearn xD. But an interresting concept. I suspect that maybe graves gets an AOE type attackanimation (shotgun). Gonna be fun to see where they are going with this.
As every preseason, crazy changes, broken shit.. then after a while everything settles, everyone still buys the same thing (although it is new this year) and has to be reworked next year. It keeps the game feeling new tho, which probably reduces the amount of players quitting.

[–]mattiejj 1 point 14 days ago 
here we targeted a group of champions (in this case six marksmen - Corki, Miss Fortune, Graves, Caitlyn, Kog’Maw, and Quinn) who occupied similar strategic spaces,

I applaud your effort at creating as much playstyle diversity in League as possible Riot, but we both know it's futile: Someone will figure out what the strongest choice is, and then we'll all copy it. It's just gamer psychology. Still, I'd rather the choices exist than one at all.

I know she is, and imo, she doesn't actually need it, its only because riot balances around LCS. I'm also assuming she's not getting it in the preseason 6 patch, in which case she would be useless without the changes between her rework and preseason 6

[–]MaxBonerstorm 1 point 13 days ago 
Anticipated Changes:
1) Graves AA is now always AoE, utilizing the shotgun design. Retooling kit to make him a strong AoE teamfighter, less so siege/poke.
2) Cait gets the exact opposite treatment, focusing a lot more on the "Sniper" aspect, long range poke with siege. Changes to the ult and trap are coming to bring synergy to this playstyle.
3) Corki full rework, VU. No idea what to expect here.
4) Kogmaw departs from a hybrid caster to a more AA focused, organic siege oriented playstyle. Complete rework of ult, and possibly small changes to his Q and W, passive stays as its too iconic.
5) Miss Fortune will utilize having two guns, firing twice at all times. Basically getting a free Lucian passive, but obviously not as strong. Her kit will revolve around AA timings and big burst combos. Probably another significant rework of her kit, breasts enlarged by 14.2%.

[–]TheFakestFaker 1 point 13 days ago 
Wow up hp pots again.... wtf riot and then you take away mana pots I always buy mana pots because you made some champions mana pools so fucking low it's retarded

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
While making this change, I made sure to look up champions who bought 2 or more mana potions and either gave them more base mana pool (moved it from their per level to their level 1) or more mana regeneration depending on their class.
Most fighter/carry types got more maximum mana early - while more supportive/utility types got more base regeneration.

[–]TheFakestFaker 1 point 13 days ago 
but then why not just keep the mana pots in whats the harm

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Balancing a champion around mana pots means effectively that he is feast or famine to begin with. You either win the lane hard early -or- you lose the lane as you pay a continuous gold sink for your spells in the form of mana pots.
If you buy anything other than mana pots early on these characters - you will be unable to support your spell casting paradigms - which means these characters are inherently less flexible in their build path and cannot pivot or respond.
The excess gold required for mana potions tends to be only available if you are ahead in the lane and have excess gold to burn. This effect is magnified by ELO and the ability to last hit - so characters reliant on mana pots are inherently more fragile and less viable for along the lower end of the skill curve. If Pantheon is balanced competitively around mana potions, the win rate of most players with Pantheon will be far below balanced, for example.
Having players rely on mana potions means that you don't really appropriately tune their base mana pool all that well, especially early - so it becomes more of a crutch for poor tuning than actually being good for the long run.

[–]TheFakestFaker 1 point 13 days ago 
its not relying on mana pots i get like 1 or 2 in the lane and they are only 35 gold and its enough to let me poke and keep my mana fine untill its time to back for a item if you are gonna up everyone mana regen to that of a current mana pot then ok thats fine if not then its just gonna suck

so with mana pots being taken out there better be some sort of buff for fiddlesticks, he has mana problems without blue and upgrading jg item just delays power for him since he never really autos in rotations

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
The starting jungle item(s) will be redone to account for this. One of the jungle item options grants increased mana regeneration in the Jungle to specifically address this concern.

I dont get it, are they replacing the valkyrie ?

[–]binet 1 point 13 days ago 
Removing the wards and the mana pots are terrible ideas. The reason why I do buy mana pots already is because some champs have ridiculous mana cost (Olaf q). This litteraly fucks up the entire lane phase before 10 min

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
Some champions do have ridiculous mana costs - absolutely. We basically took a look at every champion that bought mana pots by our data and gave them either increased mana regeneration or moved more of their mana growth to their base mana.
Mana potions simply let advanced players get around mana costs of characters who probably could've used their base mana stats adjusted anyway.

[–]binet 1 point 14 days ago 
I really appreciate the answer, I'm myself probably the biggest olaf player in the entire game and I have a unique playstyle in which mana pots are absolutely MANDATORY, please make sure olaf gets a proper mana regen so that I can reach master again this season <3 .
And good luck overall to balance this huge change among the game.

I would love it if Ward can target ally and doing so transfer 1 ward to him. There is cases where people pick sweeper over ward trinket and they can't contribute to the vision control as much as warding.

[–]StoneyMcGyver 1 point 13 days ago 
I don't mind that they're getting rid of buyable wards. It will only affect early game really. Once you hit 9 just upgrade you're trinket and you won't even need to buy wards at that point!

[–]Alteffour 1 point 14 days ago 
agreed. but what's scary is the thought of how few people even upgrade their trinkets. in fact, i'd wager that most of the people i play with forget that they even have a trinket. so yeah.

[–]StoneyMcGyver 1 point 14 days ago 
Sadly in the lower divisions no one upgrades their trinkets and vision is such a key part of the game! I always try to remind teammates to upgrade when they have the spare gold.

[–]TyriuGet Rengar'd 1 point 13 days ago 
As a jungler, the lack of Green Wards it's really depressing. One the things that make me climb really up, was the fact that I warded the enemy jungle constantly. I could find the enemy jungler while doing his buff and kill him easly. While still warding Dragon and river. And now? Everyone got free wards. So actually spending time and money on warding isn't rewarding anymore.

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
We're streamlining the Jungle items a bit. There will be a mini-sightstone option for your Tier 2 Jungle item.
You basically choose between a 2-charge sightstone, chilling smite for ganking or challenging smite for brawling - the other options have been mostly removed.

[–]TyriuGet Rengar'd 1 point 13 days ago 
p
You removed Ranger too? How weak early junglers are supposed to clear? Thanks for the response.

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Typically 'weak early' junglers were barred not at Tier 2 - but by being so far behind that Tier 2 was completely out of reach for them (or by the time you got Tier 2 - you needed so much overcompensation to catch up - hence Ranger's) - so the focus is getting it to the point where everyone has a decent path to the Tier 2 items.
While there are still spot cases that are having a rough time (mostly Assassin type junglers) - there are other options for sustain in the Jungle for power farmers - especially ones that basically allow you to circumvent the 'potion tax' of clearing the jungle repeatedly.
This isn't a completely solved issue - but as with any jungle change - there's likely to be turnover in the jungle pool.

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
What about Rangers for farming. Removing that will make it a lot harder for off meta junglers

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Depending on the degree of 'off-meta' - there's some systems in place that support off-meta junglers a bit.
Patience, for example, enables junglers to be able to kite camps. There are some mana and flask targetted changes that allow farming the jungle to be sustainable without relying on Ranger's smite to do it for you.
It really depends on who you're talking about. Brand / Zyra / Snare Mage junglers got a lot more supported with the addition of a different starting item path for them - while some other characters are a bit weaker due to their reliance on rangers. The jungle pool will likely turnover - as it will with any change.

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago* 
I mean something a bit different. Sometimes when I play Rengar I would use rangers because his sustain is not that great and his clears are slow until late game. Another example would be building Rangers on Diana since she will be farming until 6 anyway or Rangers on Zac because his clears are slow and the AoE damage and stun really helps. So will there be options for junglers who need a little help clearing to be effective and not completely off-meta picks EDIT: I saw the screen shot of the hunters talisman and I see how that would work just another question would the Talisman build into the same items the same way the machete does and will the machete stay

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
I know that Rengar will most likely suffer from this due to his unique profile - unsure how bad it is - but there's always turnover from specific junglers.
As far as to how Machete + Talisman goes - every Tier 2 jungle item will require both Machete and Talisman to be built - so you'll eventually have both passives from both items.
That is - Skirmisher's Sabre, Tracker's Knife and Stalker's Blade all require both Machete and Talisman.

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
So will jungle items become more expensive or not need the normal item like warrior building from brutaliser and runeglaive from sheen. Will the enchantments eg warrior or runeglaive stay the same with slight stat changes or new enhancements and can you possibly provide a build path for a max tier jungle item. Thank you so much for answering my questions

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Most items have had their gold costs readjusted to due a huge gold efficiency and gold premium path that we've done so even if I gave specific values - it'd probably be inaccurate as we've adjusted almost every gold source and gold item efficiency in the game to match.
None of the recipes have changed - almost everything is slightly more expensive but there's also modifications to how you earn gold overall so even if I gave specific numbers - it'd be a little meaningless unfortunately. ;x

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
Thank you so much last thing where does the Hunters Talisman fit into the build path since normally it would be Machete -> Stalkers + (2 Long Swords -> Brutilizer) -> Stalkers with warrior enhancement

In that short clip about the Rift Herald, it doesn't look like Renekton does any damage to it at all.. is this gonna be something only a jungle item can effectively damage or what? Wouldn't seem like much of a top laners objective if it's only to help his jungler secure it.

[–]ChipyGlitchy 1 point 14 days ago 
Im thinking it would be something where if you have a heavy split pusher top lane you would hand it to them, if you have a jungle thats always in lane you hand it to them.
you could even take a mid lane siege champ and hand it to them as well.

[–]b1ackRose 1 point 14 days ago 
Yeah, but I'm saying it can't be taken without the jungler being there.
It might just be a weird clip, the Yi might have hella items and Renek none, it's just the clip that looks odd.

[–]ChipyGlitchy 1 point 14 days ago 
I get what you're saying I just mean that I think it's a situation where the jungler has to choose who it goes to, like if the jungle is the primary damage on it and they pass it off then they have to risk doing it smiteless etc.

[–]mart99 1 point 13 days ago 
That item still exist?

[–]Fuey500 1 point 13 days ago

[–]Snowodin 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm honestly loving most of what they're describing, but I think my favorite thing about preseason 6 is going to be those keystone masteries.

[–]Rakorn 1 point 13 days ago 
Wardjumps are out i guess? i look at u lee sin....RIP INSEC

[–]wambleeska 2 points 13 days ago 
no, i'm sure sight stone exists but you just cant cant buy single wards

[–]-Cerastes-[Snake on bush] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
We still have SightStone and Totem trinket.
So nope.

[–]NSYoung 1 point 13 days ago 
Brace yourself, Preseason is Coming.

[–]SaracenCain 1 point 13 days ago 
Those new mastery pictures look interesting. Maybe a Human brand and human Xerath? I can't tell who would fit the middle one though.

[–]ImDeJang 1 point 13 days ago 
Looks left and looks right?
Where is lucian update?

[–]marttttt 1 point 13 days ago 
They said the new items will benefit him a lot! I really hope they do.
Essence reaver is getting reworked and is going to be strong on him.

[–]ImDeJang 1 point 14 days ago 
I really hope so. Lucian was my go to adc back in season 4. Then they nerfed him so mich that I didn't even want to play adc anymore.

[–]marttttt 1 point 14 days ago 
I'm exactly the same, I went from a Lucian only kinda player to a support main when they nerfed him

[–]Blackgun007 1 point 13 days ago 
"for those about to ward up (we salute you)"
Loving Riot for those sneaky references

[–]Sickritokidfam 1 point 13 days ago 
At least pre-season 6 sounds way more interesting than pre-season 4/5 did! thx rito <3

[–]Slna 1 point 13 days ago 
Removing stealth wards from the shop makes no sense!!! I mean the purchase of wards, deviating money from item purchases to ward purchases adds another layer to the game and distinguishes great players!! The careless players who never buy wards when they back now get a bonus?? The players whose biggest quality was vision control get a kick in the nuts? Hell no!!!

[–]mortles 1 point 14 days ago 
Lets see what they actually made, the article is kinda sketchy but I understand your stance.

[–]-Cerastes-[Snake on bush] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
Nah... they are just making Trinkets to be the main player in Vision wars.

[–]BrendonAG92 1 point 13 days ago 
I said before that if they want top lane to be more engaged in the game, they need there to be a reason to go to top lane. We obviously don't know the specifics, but it's nice that there are now more options for junglers and in turn it gives top laners a place in the game without using TP.

[–]Lauiiigyrocopter ripoff 4Head 1 point 13 days ago 
"we are riot and we change the game every season :))))"

[–]thdotm 1 point 13 days ago 
What is going to happen to Evelynn with the new wards??

[–]pawofdoom 1 point 13 days ago 
While we're at it can we get more than 3 bans? You gave us 6/6 god tier picks during the last set of reworks, give us a chance at a fun game at least.

[–]LunarDDKąiryu 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm glad I've spent 100 days asking my friends to learn how to ward because I climbed to diamond by playing vision game LOL. So is sightstone staying? Or only pinks will stay?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 14 days ago 
Sightstone is staying. Yellow trinket (base) has added functionality.

[–]LunarDDKąiryu 1 point 13 days ago 
Good to know :) looking forward for the changes

[–]TheSneakySeal 1 point 13 days ago 
No jungle item changes? At least fix/nerf runeglaive. Elise nerfs?

[–]bonafide_smile 1 point 13 days ago 
So when is riot going to fix pings?

[–]axaddonwatch out for my kill move 1 point 13 days ago 
the new monster in toplanes gonna be interesting. I personally like it as I usually roam top more then bot, so it's an objective i can take often

[–]Modullah 1 point 13 days ago 
R.I.P EZREAL. My favorite adc has been neglected for so long now. Please, the "buff" to his arcane shift was nothing.

[–]Zfusco 1 point 13 days ago 
Hah, now I never have to ward. Diamond here I come.

[–]Tortillagirl 1 point 13 days ago 
Certainly an interesting list of aims, Rift Herald reads as a single target baron buff. I would assume with reduced AP/AD compared to normal baron buff. Certainly would be interesting to see how that works in a soloq setting.
Potion changes are welcome. Sustain is pretty crazy at the moment, less sustain means more calculated plays and places to punish bad play.
I'm not overly sold on the mastery changes, sounds exactly like what happened in WoW with talent trees swapping to option somethings at the start of cataclysm.
While it wasnt that bad in WoW, considering people in LoL struggle with changing up item builds mid game to suit opponents. How are people going to change talents pre game with the forethought about what they need based on theirs and their opponents team comps?
The 6 marksmens named dont really occupy similar strategic places, but they do with other champions so i assume it was porely worded.
Corki for example is midgame power and poke/burst. Hes fairly special in his own right i think.
Miss Fortune just lacks damage to make her feel like a wombo combo compared to say the burst of a graves or a lucian ultimate.
Graves ive always felt occupied a very similar space to what Lucian ended up being, but they moved lucian into a more mobile version. As far as how he feels, i always felt he was a bruiser AD. With his passive and buckshot doing more damage with multi barrel hits he just needs tweaks to make him a more in your face marksmen that can actually do that without just dieing. I think if he somehow did more damage the closer he was to people, and maybe took more damage the further away people were/took less when they are closer sort of thing.
Caitlyn used to be about pushing early into lategame strength. This is overshadowed by Tristana and Jinx who are simply better at everything basically except her early game strength.
Kog'maw is a weird one, because in a way he is close to Corki for midgame spike with poke. But hes always been about lategame pre TF build paths and with Lulu and Juggermaw that is his main niche. Hes just not that good compared to say Jinx without a lulu there to buff him up.
As for Quinn... i dont know, shes meant to be some splitpush/assassin hybrid ADC. I like the idea but it just never seemed to work consistently. Espcially given her poor 2v2 laning so she had to toplane for the most part. And then you lacked tanks. Vayne is simply better than her in general for that.
I think just moving botlane carries in general away from 100% marksment with the likes of mordekaiser/kindred additions. Allows a space for Quinn to be a sololane carry.
Marksmen can lane in every lane now, Varus/Ezreal/Corki all good midlanes. Quinn/Vayne are good toplane. Kindred as a jungler. Then you have late game ADCS like Jinx/Trist/Ashe who all live duo lanes.
Which is great for the game, but we wont see true diversity without more options for duo laners botlane that arnt marksmen.
Once you have multiple non ADC picks for botlane, you will see team comps that have the AD in a different lane (like top) but can counteract the fact they dont have a tank/bruiser from top but having a viable option to pick in the botlane.
Really hope the items help a lot in this too. BT meta... IE meta... its annoying theres a singularly strong build path that in a way makes the best options for ADC picks on its own.

[–]punkerdante182 1 point 13 days ago 
Aw no love for ezreal :/. He's always been my favorite marksmen for his skill to play and just his uniqueness overall. But (like most adc's) he's gotten left in the dirt by assasin's and juggarnauts.

[–]HeliusLoL 1 point 13 days ago 
why do they keep trying to balance the game around pro play... they're trying to force us to cooperate with our team, literally giving power to the trolls

[–]herbye53 1 point 14 days ago 
Because it's a team game. There will always ALWAYS be trolls, mate.

[–]-Cerastes-[Snake on bush] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
why do they keep trying to balance the game around pro play...
Because they actually know how to play the game.
There is no other way to balance, unless you want to royally fuk up the game and make it intentionally imbalanced.
And no shit they are forcing us to cooperate with our team, it's a team game after all.
Go play your single-player games dude. This game is not for you.

[–]HeliusLoL 1 point 13 days ago 
don't get me wrong, i love league. i've been playing for years and have way too many games. but they're just making it way too hard to climb considering the only person you can fully rely on is yourself, making it alot harder to climb ranks, you can't solo carry off of skill alone anymore which is a tad annoying.

[–]Blackgun007 1 point 13 days ago 
preseason changes
no harder jungle
Wtf you had ONE job Riot

[–]EtrianDemifiend 1 point 13 days ago 
No more wards. No more mana pots. Quinn rework.
Holy moly

[–]narpilepsy 1 point 13 days ago 
Don't really like their decision to remove stealth wards
like wasn't it their goal a few patches ago to get people to invest more in vision and map control? How does this make any sense?
And no mana pots? Yeah that's fine it's not like I wanted to win lane against Yasuo or Zed or Katarina anyway. no big deal amirite
Though I gotta say I'm excited to see the marksmen getting some attention! (I hope they don't completely butcher Caitlyn...)

[–]stillwindninja 1 point 13 days ago 
yellow trinkets starts with 2 wards automatically
blue trinket now has increased vision
riot is going to adjust base mana regen and per level mana regen on champions effected by removal of mana pots
inb4 6 new perma bans

[–]LordKira00 1 point 13 days ago 
I know that Riot is changing Marksman in the preseason, but will it also nerf the AP version of the champion? EX: AP Ezreal and AP Kog'Maw?

[–]cstew223 1 point 13 days ago 
MFW nothing here is about teleport.............

[–]butthe4d 1 point 14 days ago 
To be fair changing the CD from a summoner spell is not really worth mentioning in such a blog.

[–]Zombie-Feynman 1 point 13 days ago 
As a jungler, increasing the price of health pots hurts. Hopefully they'll make some other changes to help keep junglers with rough early clears viable.

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
Yeah - Jungle monster initial damage came down a bit - both to compensate from the changes to defensive masteries and some adjustments to starting items.

[–]Zombie-Feynman 1 point 13 days ago 
Good to know, thanks!

[–]LARXXX 1 point 13 days ago 
idk about taking away green wards. these changes dont look very good honestly. riot trying to do too much and ruining the game in the process

[–]SouthAfricanGuy94 1 point 13 days ago 
That gold item from the Bilgewater event should definitely be added. It would help out marksman so much.

[–]Detfs[T o] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Health pots are going up in price
So will the starting items be changed be lowered or will we have more starting gold so champions getting Doran's Blade can still get at least one potion?

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
Both.
Starting gold is now 500. Starting items have had their costs readjusted.
I... may need to figure out some better tank starting options. It's just hard to make them good without them becoming automatically default. :x

[–]Detfs[T o] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Sounds amazing, thanks Xypherous.

[–]ClapsForFairies 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm not a designer by any means, but what if new jungle item for tanks was something like "the damage taken is reflected back by X% and the percent increases by Y% over a certain time" I'm not good at explaining this, but the longer you take damage, the more is returned. So it's really terrible for the first 10 (too high?) seconds, but ramps up. It might have the same problem that quill coat did, but, like I said, I'm not a designer, and this was just an uninformed suggestion :S

[–]razzamatazz 1 point 13 days ago 
This mastery system feels just like the talent trees from WoW.. i hated those damn trees.

[–]PhantomAdmit[Phantom Admit] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
So with the removal of mana pots, will you also change crystalline flask and biscuits?

[–]KladiasWin or lose, it's Cloud9 we choose! 1 point 13 days ago 
Seems like it's time to find out which ADCs in the competitive scene are able to adapt and prosper, just as how S5 was for junglers...
Can't wait for the changes to go live!

[–]butthe4d 1 point 13 days ago 
I have no idea how this will be playing out but it sounds really good. I like a more meaning full mastery tree.

[–]Hamad_Senpai 1 point 13 days ago 
Ok and don't forget Graves cigar please.
I know you don't want to apply it in-game because it's sort of as encouraging smoking for the young people playing league. Truly it will showcase that smoking will make you look epic and fun when it's not. But, that's the idea of it being placed as a /taunt reference.
Maybe figure this one out for implementation later? #PlsRiot #partypooper

[–]garduglo 1 point 13 days ago 
Since mana pots are seemingly gone what does this mean for the item Catalyst Flask? I hope they don't remove it. It is such a vital item on champions with huge mana cost or weak laning phases like champions like Singed, Malphite, Sion, Kassadin, Yorick, or Pantheon?

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
The Flask will remain - though it's been heavily heavily altered. Provides Health and Mana... and may or may not set your opponents on fire when you hit them.
On the downside, you can't stack regular health potions with it anymore - as that combination was a nightmare to balance and really prevented us from having Flask starts be tolerable.

[–]garduglo 1 point 13 days ago 
Thank you so much for responding but since we can't stack hp pots with it does flask get more charges or do the charges remain the same?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Each charge restores more health and mana.

[–]Slaskpojken 1 point 13 days ago 
For the second goal, we’re removing Stealth Wards from the shop
does not compute

[–]tvturtle 1 point 13 days ago 
Each mastery tree will have three tiers. Each successive tier you > invest in, you’ll be able to pick up some stats and a choice of one of three potential masteries (you can only choose one!).
We guild wars 2 now?

[–]MasterOfChiefs 1 point 13 days ago 
Graves is my favorite adc and in my top three favorite champions, if not the top, please don't fuck him up. As for the health potion thing, unless I'm understanding this incorrectly, would you not be once again centralizing the jungle if you increase the price of pots? After Hunter's Machete, only two potions can be bought and if the price increases so that only one can be bought, would high sustain junglers not be the only ones that could succeed?

[–]bestleblancEUW 1 point 13 days ago 
Better fix reconnect option... Its most game breaking bug ever...

[–]im_naughty 1 point 13 days ago 
If they're increasing prices on health pots then they better make jungle monsters do less DMG early. TONS of junglers on their second pot to to an efficient first clear.

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 14 days ago 
THY WILL BE DONE.
I mean - yeah, that's something we did - we had to compensate for both masteries changing, the starting item changes and the multiple starting item paths.

I really hope they get rid of the warding limit now that green wards are disappearing

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
It's true that it doesn't serve much of a purpose now that green wards are gone - but I'd like to see the system settle down a bit more before I decide whether or not stacking Sightstone + Yellow into 6 ward control is a good idea.

[–]PillarOfIce 1 point 13 days ago 
The ward limit will still affect champions who purchase sightstone since they could potentially place 7 stealth wards (5 from ruby plus 2 from the new yellow trinket).

[–]louisplasta 1 point 13 days ago 
you telling me that I can't invest $150 to avoid ganking from other lanes anymore?bullsh*t

[–]Dexmoachin 1 point 13 days ago 
So does that mean that Flask will no longer replenish mana as well?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Flask will still replenish Mana.
Since Flask is a permanent item that is fairly high cost - it's closer to buying a sapphire crystal than a cheap consumable potion.

[–]strangeduck 2 points 13 days ago 
you should be removing flask rather than buffing it giving people that much sustain leads to a really boring midlane and in cases like fizz/kass it gives them a free pass on their weak early laning.

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
We're removing the ability for you to have both Flask and Healing potions - and so curbing the sustain factor of that early build path significantly.

[–]CaptainLepidus 1 point 13 days ago 
Are you concerned about mana hungry duo laners who can't realistically start flask? For example, will Blitzcrank have reduced mana costs so he can stay viable without mana pots or flask?

[–]RiotXypherous 4 points 13 days ago 
Most of the duo laners who bought more than one mana potion had mana regeneration adjustments to their level 1 value.
Blitzcrank is one of the characters on that list.

[–]Juliandroid98SKTelecom T1 1 point 13 days ago 
Is there a list available somewhere which champions got affected by the mana regen buff? Cause I'm interested to see.

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
Not currently - unless someone has data scraped champion statistic changes.

[–]xHalfBakedGuy 1 point 13 days ago 
looks like one of the adc items gives range? trist was never able to attack the turret w/o standing in it.. maybe one that gives active range.. would be pretty cool

[–]jamzxd 1 point 13 days ago 
the fact that they aren't targetting ezreal is pretty damn annoying, still pretty sweet though

[–]moobeat[S] 2 points 13 days ago 
nope, they're even adding some upgrade options

[–]brianlights22 1 point 13 days ago 
I think its more of all support items will be able to either upgrade into their normal item OR add sightstone capabilities instead of their normal activations, and thus getting rid of normal sight stone

[–]rroca9[rroca9] (LAS) 1 point 13 days ago 
No more stealth wards? No more mana pots? Changes to starting items? I'm excited about the ADC changes but I have my doubts about this. I'll wait until the PBE gets updated and see how it goes.

[–]Dugand 1 point 13 days ago 
Hmm is there a way to keep mana pots in other game mods? Other then that it looks good to me, cant wait to try it out in PBE

[–]Chrakker 1 point 13 days ago 
Actually, hasn't this sub feared of the lack of warding so much, that it became a pun to remove stealth wards entirely from the shop? I really feel uncomfortable reading exactly this now.

"WTF. Master Yi stole herald buff. AFK"

[–]LemonInYourEyes 1 point 13 days ago 
Clarity: Adding game-changing masteries that are unique to each player, that can't be seen by teammates, or opponents, unless they use a third-party website. What we have now seems fine, everyone more or less runs the same masteries. But these keystone masteries sound like they are going to add more diversity while reducing transparency. How long is it going to take before we can actually see what we can/not and what our enemies can/not do?!?!

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Actually, the masteries will be on the in-game scoreboard - so you can tab and check out what their most powerful game-changing mastery choice is. Unsure as to whether or not we'll be getting it on loading screen - I'm not directly involved with the exact specifics of the display.
I believe we're also getting hover tooltips for these as well.
Good thought though - very thorough.

[–]Xenodia 1 point 13 days ago 
So you basically made Draven's old passive into a Mastery (the Bleeding one)? Ok why the heck not xD

[–]LemonInYourEyes 1 point 13 days ago 
Good news then, the there going to be any other significant changes related to this? Rune pages? How about getting physical numbers for level up info for abilities? I know the stance on this in the past has been no due to burden of information or something like that, when in reality, it seems to many to be the exact opposite. Thanks for the response.

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago* 
Let me clarify - we're only displaying the one game-changing mastery selection not all - in no way are we giving you complete info-dumps of your opponent.
Overall - while there is always some value in knowing every single possible scrap of information that you can get your hands on the opponent - there's a threshold of information importance which we really don't want it to be part of the main game experience.

[–]LemonInYourEyes 1 point 13 days ago 
This really boggles the mind. OK, I concede knowing every scrap of info in-game is overwhelming. But there is a serious gap between what should be displayed to influence meaningful decisions in-game, compared to what is displayed currently.
Why is it always decided for us what information we want? It's like teachers giving the base answer and giving the base minimum to help their students. Yeah, it works for getting students to pass standardized tests. Want to be successful in the real world? Want to learn something useful? Ha. Joke's on you.
You didn't exactly say yes or no to either of my questions, so I'll open the floor again.

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Oh - my apologies. I'm not aware of any attempts to expose rune page information or the level-up numbers for opponents while you are in-game - I highly doubt we'd do that for the future.

[–]LemonInYourEyes 1 point 13 days ago 
Not for opponents, for yourself.

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
So will you only be able to get one Keystone mastery so not 2 from different trees

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
The keystone mastery is at the end of the tree - 17 points down - so it's impossible with 30 points to get 2.

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
ohh so because you can only get one keystone mastery per tree and you do not have the points to max out 2 trees there will be a maximum of 1 keystone mastery so thats what will be shown. Thanks

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
Surely for example mastered which do additional damage would have visual VFX and would show up on you bar if it is damage over time

[–]youatemyonlyfood 1 point 13 days ago 
Anyone else think the "Rift Herald" was a new Malphite skin at first?

[–]Artomiix 1 point 13 days ago 
HOLY SHIT I'm so hyped, I don't even know who to buy.
There's Illaoi coming out, but man these marksman changes, I'm thinking about getting Lucian or Kog'Maw now.

[–]HeroicTechnology 1 point 13 days ago 
D-d-d-did someone say...
Stealth wards are only on trinkets
Baron relavance in the form of evolving monsters
Streamlined masteries in the form of passives
DAWNGATE?

[–]DarthLeon2[Slamurai Jack] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Mana pot? What's a mana pot?

[–]Paradoxors 1 point 13 days ago 
Anyone else think that the removal of stealth wards was also meant as an indirect nerf to TP?

[–]Hurenschande 1 point 13 days ago 
well, there are still stealth wards, you just are not able to buy them. So either you have to have a green trinket (and thus not the red one :/) or you need to buy a vision item.

[–]ibgnar 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm actually pretty excited for the changes.

[–]Fl1pz 1 point 13 days ago

PLEASE DON'T REMOVE MANA POTS. I love buying them on Garen, Kat, and Riven

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
Even though they don't need the extra boost, I'm sure Garen/Kat/Riven have always appreciated the smooth flavor of Mana Pot Classic.

[–]WhyNotZoidbergPlsBard Main 2 points 13 days ago 
For real though, can't you just nerf mana pots, or atleast keep them as a gag item that gives no mana?

[–]laxboy119 1 point 13 days ago

[–]daybreakinz 1 point 13 days ago 
ΝΑ SMITE

[–]_Juno_ 1 point 13 days ago 
But why is the vision being changed? What exactly is wrong with it?
Warding was already a team effort and people won't change. If they didn't ward then, they won't ward now. And how exactly does removing something make it more dynamic?
Eh, we'll see how it works out, but I don't see why you have to fix something that ain't broke.
omg no my mana pots !!

[–]RiotXypherous 3 points 13 days ago 
Basically, vision has about 13 moving parts to it at the moment. A lot of which are redundant with one another. They all use a hybrid mixture of wards, inventory spaces, gold costs and ward maximum limits in order to pan out.
Additionally, the fact that wards still take up your inventory slots even though the trinket system was explicitly designed to relieve inventory pressure in that way made the value of pinks questionable. (Let's not even get to how useless pre 9 blue is - or the yellow/pink upgrade - or how easy it is to forget to upgrade yellow - or how useless Ruby was.)
Lastly - judging by the states of the game - the map was much too bright for our liking and we'd like to darken it. The map being too bright at key areas meant an overreliance on wall hops for effectiveness and degraded a lot of gank paths as they would most likely be lit up.
Lastly, you're absolutely right in that removing Sight Wards alone won't make the vision system more dynamic. This is a fairly big set of changes targeted at condensing and streamlining the vision aspects to work under a much more condense set of cohesive rules - while also hitting some other side goals like darkening the map.
It's not broken, per se - it's just doing some things we dislike and it's incredibly hard to expand upon.

[–]chelly13 1 point 13 days ago 
Because it isn't dark enough already when it seems like every game only 1 person, the support, on each team is actually warding?

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
To be fair - In that specific case - the removal of green wards won't actually make the map darker, since they'll be capped out via Sightstone.

[–]Fuuyutsuki 1 point 13 days ago 
Am I the only one who noticed that Tristanas AA is longer range than tower shots? What is this

[–]Hurenschande 1 point 13 days ago 
That's a new item

[–]Kologe 1 point 13 days ago 
Ok so I almost have to learn a new game after worlds :D

[–]crowcawer 1 point 13 days ago 
By giving you the ability to see the dead bodies of wards who’ve moved on with their lives, you’ll be able to learn more about your opponent’s vision habits as well as your own.
And so my map will be crummy?

[–]terryaki510 1 point 13 days ago 
There are going to need to be a LOT of adjustments to ability mana costs before mana pots being removed won't fuck over certain champions. Looking at you, Lissandra.

[–]Novokuv 1 point 13 days ago 
I play a TON of Lissandra and I have never bought a health pot since you can easily manage it if you don't waste it for minions.
Also most of my mana regen comes from utilizing my passive and Dorans Blade passive.

[–]terryaki510 2 points 13 days ago 
I think you meant to say mana pots and doran's ring.
I've always had a lot of trouble in early laning with lissandra's mana costs because her main harass ability costs 85 mana at level 1. Compare that to GP's parrley, which is comparable to lissandra's q in it's lane usage. Even after the nerfs in 5.21, his q mana cost is 40. It's ridiculous that these two comparable abilities have a 45 mana cost difference from the outset, and in my experience Lissandra's passive is not sufficient to make up this gap. Furthermore, even if the passive does sufficiently offset the high mana costs so that you can afford to harass just as much as a GP, then what's the point of having a passive at all? Might as well just have reasonable mana costs at level 1, and have no passive.
Granted I don't play a huge amount of Lissandra games, so I'll admit part of the issue is probably how I play her. I just wanted to bring up the point that, while Riot is saying that it is currently unfair that mana pots are more effective on certain champions, this means that their removal will be equally unfair to those same champions.

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
But they will compensate by giving lissandra either higher mana regen more mana in total or a shorter CD on passive

[–]terryaki510 2 points 13 days ago 
yeah I just hope they do a good job of compensating accordingly. We'll just have to wait and see, but I feel like it'll be at least a few patches in before base mana and mana regen get to the levels they need to be for all champions. I like the idea of having champions not be as gated by mana, but I feel like manaless champs are probably going to be quite strong for the first few patches

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
I am thinking riot could over buff the mana champions so they will be op being able to spam their skills or the other way round

[–]bulkygorilla 1 point 13 days ago

As a top lane main, the giant eye on the Rift Herald just reminds me of how little wards we buy.

[–]jal0001 1 point 13 days ago 
Step 1: play Thresh Kalista bot lane.
Step 2: send your jungler top.
Step 3: pretend to over extend to bait enemy teleport.
Step 4: get free rift warden.

If you're going to remove mana pots I hope Riot plan to fix up the old champs like Yorrick who have the most garbage mana costs on their spells...

[–]IcarusDive 1 point 13 days ago 
Every single mana user in this game will have to either be revised to fit this. There are some that do not need it but here are others that are going to cry blood. Malphite heavily comes to mind, the guy is almost as mana starved as galio.

No jungle changes ? What a time to be alive

[–]Sozia 1 point 13 days ago 
As an eve main I have a few questions I was hoping you could answer.
With the removal of stealth wards and the new emphasis on pink wards how do you think this will impact eves early/mid ganking ability? If it will lower her ability to gank lanes do you have any plans to buff her ability to farm the jungle? My concerns are that if everyone is pink warding their lane it drastically reduces eves effectiveness at early game ganks and forces her more towards a farming strategy to keep up with the pace of the game.
Are you happy with eves identity at the moment? she's either played primarily as an AP assassin jungler or an AP/AD bruiser jungler, I know a rioter has stated before that to be viable as an assassin eve would most likely have to become a lane champ, is this the direction your most likely to go or are you happy to have her stay as primarly a jungle champion?

Pink wards will remain. Buyable Green Wards are the only ones disappearing.

[–]Juliandroid98SKTelecom T1 1 point 13 days ago 
Why did the team decide to do that? junglers are at a huge disadvantage because they can only buy pinks or have to waste a inventory slot for a sightstone.

This image has LOTS of the new items from the preseason.

[–]JudasLover 1 point 13 days ago 
Omg are they gonna replace Mejai's with Dark Seal? Infinite scaling + some sustain instead of capped stacks but less starting AP?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Mejai's builds out of the Dark Seal.

[–]JudasLover 1 point 13 days ago 
So Mejai's stats will change too? In what way?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Currently just trying out % MS as the end-cap bonus - and it giving a bit of base mana as well.
It'll gain more stacks on kill, lose more stacks on death and grant more AP per stack than the Dark Seal - making it a "double-down" approach to the item.
We're deliberately shifting away from 'perfect play' as being the prime motivator for the item - but time will tell whether or not that's actually a good spot for Mejai's to be in.

[–]JudasLover 1 point 13 days ago 
Doesn't Luden's occupy the AP-speed item place already? Also Lich Bane has some speed, why does Mejai's need speed?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
I've found that 'Gambit' items such as Mejai's do need to share significant overlap with parts of your build - otherwise, you can't find an item to replace when your Gambit works out.
For example, imagine if Mejai's only gave AP. At the end of the day - you still have a ton of other needs that you need to fill out - and so, even if you could succeed at the gambit - pure AP wouldn't be worth going down that route.
As for having a unique output / identity - that gets trickier as well, mostly due to the fact that since the unique output is conditional - it compounds the difficulty of assessing whether or not the Gambit was worthwhile in the first place.
I'm not sure I understand the item space the item is playing in at the moment and I'm sure I'll need to adjust it in the future.

[–]JudasLover 1 point 13 days ago 
I guess you need to keep the item's users and their needs in mind. Can't think of anyone other than Lux though... who else?

[–]Popopopper123 1 point 13 days ago 
Won't it be a problem for new players to not have all of the masteries, because the keystone masteries are so much stronger than the others?

[–]DestructiveDust 1 point 13 days ago 
The biggest question I have: how am I supposed to play jungler and assassins. You NEED wards to assassinate people but also vision clearing. you need the sweeper = no wards. Jungler mostly buy sweeper to deny vision and buy wards to set vision up. So sightstone = normal buildpath for jungler now?

[–]Owltie 1 point 13 days ago 
i love the Quinn changes, the corki one is pretty awesome too.

[–]aChillDude 1 point 13 days ago 
The mana pot removal is a pretty big hit to some more aggressive support laners (mainly blitz and thresh come to mind). I think this change will bring around more tank supports who done necessarily need to rely on mana a lot to trade like Braun and tahm. By the time they need a mans pot you've already likely won/lost a trade or your adc has farmed enough to be able to back. We'll have to see what the mastery changes bring but the mana pot removal is going to hurt support diversity over mid/top diversity

[–]Anv1k 1 point 13 days ago 
I need some TL;DR :D and when will the madness start?

[–]gorahson 1 point 13 days ago 
Increasing health pots price... will this be tied in in hunters matchette changes? More expensive health pots = less sustain on the first clear for the junglers.

[–]Viktoria_secret 1 point 13 days ago 
With the current Top meta : the League of Tanks & Juggernauts, the coming rework of all ADC, the recent rework of jungle (mobs+items+new jungle mob soon), may the midlane will have some love too ? (I mean real change, not just changing item buildpath) ?

[–]chocolatetherapy 1 point 13 days ago 
I'm waiting it out, but reading that mana pots will be removed broke my little support heart.

[–]Karl_Marx_ 1 point 13 days ago 
They need to give a small MR starting item.
Champs like Akali or Kat show up mid with literally no starting item. You are basically forced to go cloth armor and pots or the more aggressive boots and pots.
However, neither help against AP.
300g item with - 3-5mr 1-3hp regen
This would be a huge buff to champs out of the meta right now.

[–]---E 1 point 13 days ago 
Dorans shield? Gives regen, health and reduces harass from auto attacks, which are the biggest threat against the champs you mentioned early game.

[–]Karl_Marx_ 1 point 13 days ago 
Gives no AP protection, and I'd rather show up with 5 pots and have extra gold to spend on a ward to enable better farming.

[–]---E 1 point 13 days ago 
There was a red post saying the cdr of essence reaver would scale with another stat (attack speed or crit or something?) so it could give up to 30% cdr.

[–]SmiteTeemoFight me 1 point 13 days ago 
It was with crit and most AD casters don't build it.

[–]DarthValerEU shall not pass! 1 point 13 days ago 
So true. Both flat ArPen and %ArPen have become shit as far as itemization goes.

[–]SmiteTeemoFight me 1 point 13 days ago 
Rift Herald seems like a shitty execution. If you contest for it and get it then you are forced to push lanes. No more tactical wave management, it's push push push until you get ganked. Seems more like a nerf than a buff, TBH.

nice changes incoming - should freshen things up

[–]jng4 1 point 13 days ago 
looks really gimmicky

[–]fro0zenwrath 1 point 13 days ago 
1)The changes on ad carries are welcome except the one on graves which is pretty awful.There is no logic behind disabling a champion in that way with no actual benefit.He wont be able to lh under tower,he ll constantly push the lane without the option to control creeps etc 2)The monster at the baron pit is not really a good idea since snowbally top laners will be able to snowball in a even more unhealthy way 3)Masteries logic should be changed from the core since always ppl just pick the ones who give better stats instead of strategical value which is no existent on masteries tree 4) I waited s6 items out of curiosity but riot doesnt seem to change her logic just releasing and modifing items to do stat interaction instead of actual gameplay interaction 5)new starting items and new starting gold cash are fine in theory but ppl will just pick the ones who are better like always p.s deleting mana pots logic is fine in a way since they wanted champs to be able to do specific things given the actual mana cost(blitz for example is really fine in lane right now on solo q because he can spam hooks because of the one mana pot he gets at starting build) 6)The most important.I dont understand why Riot tries to enforce habits on bad players.You should ward because it helps you win the game not because Riot doesnt give
you the option to do otherwise.There should be more ways to
distinguish good from bad players but they become even less.Its not all about make the champs kit harder.Its also about make the players think and riot just goes the opposite direction the last 2 years.Anyway you should delete trinkets and not wards.Mid laners and top laners used to buy wards until the end of mid game when they didnt have a slot to buy more.Im also refering at the same sentence to ppl who had a good knowledge of thre game.Bad mid laners and bad top laners rarely bought wards at all.So what you are doing is that you delete a skill that good laners used to have and everything about bad solo laners remains the same.Dont get me wrong the ppl who are pro and the ppl who are bad will remain the same but you remove a skill from ppl who used to have it like when buff timers didnt appear on the top of screen automatically.Also removing stealth wards from shop will expose carries to ward more which is dangerous.That isnt teamwork carries should just farm to late game and supports and junglers should ward for them to keep them safe until they can carry like in s2.Sorry for the wall text

Why don't Pink Wards recover lost health if they aren't destroyed yet? It's a fundamental problem with Pink Wards - once they're spotted they can be poked down no matter how hard you defend them.

[–]RiotXypherous 8 points 13 days ago 
Not a terrible idea - I recall running the tests on this once or twice and it feeling a bit oppressive when behind.
I'll have to try it again in a bit with some modified regeneration rules.

[–]S4mmiches 1 point 13 days ago 
1 hp per minute?

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
You have to make sure it doesn't regen while someone is hitting it, implying, at least, some sort of delay before regen after being damaged.

[–]S4mmiches 1 point 13 days ago 
1 hp per minute after taking damage!

[–]DoctorSteve -2 points 13 days ago 
But it should recover quickly after the delay. I'd think. It'd require testing to find the right balance. You'd also want to see if hitting it or zoning it is what would trigger the regen. There's some stuff there.

[–]krazystanbg 1 point 13 days ago 
DO IT! 1 hit Per min and 10 secs delay between taking damage and regen ez Pz

I'm pretty sure they've stated that they want TP out of midlane, but that they want to keep it as a common option top.
2 tps every game

Removing mana potions? Seriously? I still buy those on a LOT of champs even in the lategame because I don't want to be caught out after killing 3 people and die just because I didn't have mana. This isn't a fun change. Fuck you guys.

[–]Joel1995 1 point 13 days ago 
they also said that they will de compensating for it with mana regen/base mana changes.

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
To every champion? Because it sounds like some champions.

[–]RiotXypherous 2 points 13 days ago 
It's to some champions.
Specifically, the ones that our internal item purchase data suggested bought ~2 or more mana potions per game.
Which actually turns out to be like 35 champions. >.>

[–]RuneKatashima 1 point 13 days ago 
k so all I'm reading is that I'm going to die out there more often when I play because I tend to stay out kind of long with the use of mana potions.
Unless you can tell me which 35 champions :/

[–]Joel1995 1 point 13 days ago 
i would guess that if they talk about it specifically they would somehow compensate champions that need it.

[–]MelcorScarr 1 point 14 days ago 
AFAIK, he won't be reworked nearly as much as the other mentioned, possibly just number-shifting. However, there are plenty of items to come, maybe some of them make Lucian top tier.

[–]Reggae4Triceratops 1 point 14 days ago 
By removing mana pots, we can better balance champion ability costs with the mana regeneration stat while also streamlining the ‘sustain game’ of League.
Main problem I see here is tha they plan to balance all champions that are now going to struggle, problem is that many champions are likely going to be forgotten.

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
While I'm absolutely sure I've forgotten some champions (My list only had 35~ or so) - the list was generated via looking at item purchase rates of mana potions and compensating them with some level 1 mana bumps.

[–]-Cerastes-[Snake on bush] (EU-W) 1 point 13 days ago 
Any chance of Cassiopeia being on that list? :)

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
I'd have to double check. Off the top of my head, I don't believe she was on the list. It was mostly supports / ADC / top lane fighters from what I recall.

[–]Deathmarked 1 point 13 days ago 
They need to drop that "we need diversity and every game has to be unique and players have to bother choosing instead of playing" delusional BS before they keep making dumb changes and destroy their game. There is always going to be THE stronger path for every champion and people are gonna abuse the fuck out of it all the time, why is it that hard for them to figure it out after 6 years? (current jungle items and jungle poor where only 3 junglers are being played and all of those use the same enchant and smite almost all the time is a great example). Also removing stealth wards and automatic trinkets? Way to make the game even more noobfriendly like it's not enough already. Are they gonna remove last hitting aswell and make players get at least half the gold by simply autoattacking the minions?

[–]herbye53 1 point 13 days ago 
Dunno what game you're playing, but I'm constantly seeing different smites in my games which is pretty much what Riot wants. Some take Chilling for the slow, others take Trailblazing for the farming and third take Challenging (myself included) to be able to out-duel opponents.

[–]renrengar 1 point 13 days ago 
"For that first goal, we’re doing things like free trinket upgrades for all, along with the option for tier 2 support items to upgrade into either powerful tier 3 active items or slot-efficient sightstone" from what I read here, they are removing the item itself as a "consumable" but instead allowing you to ward through trinket usage

[–]A_Dragon 1 point 13 days ago 
Removal of stealth wards...health potion cost increase...mana pot removal!?!?! wtf are you thinking rito!?!

[–]GrandpaOtto 2 points 13 days ago 
if you read the article you'll know exactly what they're thinking.

[–]A_Dragon 0 points 13 days ago 
I did. They are wrong. It's just making the game easier for the low elo people, 90% of their decisions are based on "how can we make lower elo people's lives easier." Low elo people don't buy wards, so now they have an excuse not to. Did the opposing midlaner intelligently purchase a few mana potions on his back so he could have an edge in lane...well now he can't and has to rely on junglers (and this REALLY sucks because I'm gold and I can't even tell you the last time a jungler gave me blue buff) to donate their blue buffs to them. And now health pots cost more so the intelligent players that were buying them have to suffer more and get even more behind on a losing lane because they have to spend more on sustain.
I ask "what are they thinking" because it's becoming increasingly more obvious that the majority of the rioters that design the game are silver and below and don't actually understand it.

[–]Klynda 1 point 13 days ago 
Removing stealth wards from the shop. Hello?

[–]dreamingOwl 1 point 13 days ago 
Why the hell would you remove wards (except pinks) from the game? That just kills off a huge strategical factor of the game. Is Riot trying to make League more casual-friendly?

[–]HitXMan 2 points 13 days ago 
Too many bugs they couldn't fix

[–]sashadkiselev 1 point 13 days ago 
They did not remove stealth wards. You can still buy sightstone and trinket which place them just not buy them from the shop for 75G

[–]JudasLover 1 point 13 days ago 
Your yellow trinket will have 2 wards instnatly and be upgraded for free. You won't lose vision, you'll only gain gold for your build that you previously had to spend on vision :)

[–]dreamingOwl 1 point 13 days ago 
I really don't know how to feel about this. Removing wards from the game, removing mana pots, powercreeping the game a bit more and include even more flashy, fast and in their eyes "fun" stuff to appease the masses... I'm just concerned about what road League is gonna take in the future. I mean, it feels like the game is slowly losing its' identity.

Eh, as if masteries were ever even a choice anyway. The only choices ever when it came to masteries were "do you go 9/21/0 or 21/9/0 on bruisers" and "do you go 0/9/21 on supports or 0/16/14" But the actual masteries you chose were ALWAYS the same.
There were a few micro-adjustments, like getting weaving or not, or dropping a point of enchanted armor for second wind, but ultimately you once you knew the number of points you were putting into a tree, you basically followed the same patterns every time.

[–]superguardian 1 point 14 days ago 
Sightstone and trinket wards still exist (along with pinks, obviously). There's also reference to a "blue" trinket ward. Maybe this is that mandrake ward they kept iterating on in the PBE.

[–]zaszz 1 point 14 days ago 
Are you thick? Lol when you upgrade the blue trinket, and use it, it leaves behind a 1 hit ward that's visible to all sides. That's currently in the game. Maybe you just never upgraded it.

[–]TMMWhytefyre 0 points 14 days ago 
When World of Warcraft revamped the talent system from a talent tree to a talent grid, there was a lot of criticism. I can only respect their bold design innovations, now that quite a few top tier games have followed or will follow that kind of talent design, as is now being proposed in League of Legends with the new masteries.

[–]baciu14 0 points 14 days ago 
removing stealth wards what i dont freaking get it . so as a top laner should i just accept im getting camped or what ? plus no more mana pots ? what about ryze ? or i dunno if u spam a lot and u have no mana you are just forced to go back ? well i have 50 gold but i cant seem to buy something for me to stay in lane for 1 more minute ahh shit im just 200 gold away from item :/(i feel skeptical of these changes )

[–]RiotXypherous 1 point 13 days ago 
Supports that relied on mana pots got a mp/5 bump at their level 1 stat.
This also has the side effect of making any future mp/5 items even more effective on you.
Additionally, specifically in the support role, Frostfang had a bump in its regeneration values as it wasn't very cost efficient.

[–]Profoundsoup 2 points 13 days ago* 
Thanks so much for the reply and information :) Im glad Frostfang and is getting a look at because IMO its pretty worthless compared to coin.

It’s no secret that players who depart for the top lane can end up feeling isolated without a dragon to contest.

Yes. We call the remedy for that "TP", which is short for "teleport", a summoner spell. You know, the one you want to nerf?

Eeeh. It's more of a buff/nerf.
You can't stack it with potions - but it'll provide more health on its own.
It'll provide more mana - but it'll be more expensive.
When it's active - you'll also burn champions for DoT damage each time you hit them - enabling Flask to perform some short-term dominance type playstyles.

[–]linkchomp 2 points 14 days ago 
Not at all. A change in warding requirements, something that actually pushes trinket use a bit more is very likely going to be a good thing. Especially with their free and automatic upgrade since so many people still tend to make that the absolute last thing they touch or never do at all.
Almost every game I still have to point out to use and upgrade trinkets and it often goes ignored, but then I see complaints that only X side of the map has any wards and Y side without any is constantly being bullied.

[–]airz23s_coffee -1 points 14 days ago 
Some seriously interesting changes. No normal wards is the scariest for me. How are split pushers gonna split push?
whether you want to be a lone gunman, dueling on the edge of the fight, or the nimble spellcaster, or the siege machine and tower crusher, we’re providing you with the right items to buy so you can take out the right targets."

If you removing Wards from the shop can you also make it that we can buy Ward Skins for IP now? Also since Chroma skins were/are a total failure can you let us finally buy it with IP?

As a player that's been playing since Nautilus patch:
Relearn everything about the game in preseason
Adjust to several major changes in the meantime
Readjust to several "the meta is boring, fix(/break) it" patches
Adjust to several major meta changes shortly before Worlds, because pros excelling with certain champs or items gets that shit changed for everyone
Yeah, I'm done.
I stopped playing League regularly during mid Season 4 because i was expecting to play a fun game, but i actually had to constantly play catch up with major changes, since i don't have an ungodly amount of time to dedicate to it daily.
The game became a chore and a forced learning experience. It wasn't as bad for Season 2 and 3, but 4 and 5 just pushed it over the limit - heaven forbid you weren't able to play the game for a month or two, so much shit changed in 4&5 in such a short time period.
When i stopped playing, i suddenly had a lot more free time on my hands, as well as being exposed to less stress overall.
So long. Fuck me if all this shit isn't starting to feel cultish.

If you dont have time dont play the game, thats fine. Saying that this is true for the majority of the players by pulling stats out of your ass or that its bad for the game in general, thats retarded.

[–]-Gaka- -1 points 14 days ago 
Removing Stealth Wards seems really.... not good. Trinkets are not up nearly enough and do not cover nearly a decent enough range to protect yourself if you want it from ganks. For late game vision, removing them and providing other options is ok at best, bet for early game vision I can't imagine this is going to go well.
The dead ward bit is also kinda... less interesting. If they stick around permanently, it's simply just bad. If they stick around for 30 seconds or a minute, I can see it being kinda neat.
Overall, wards really shouldn't be removed. Free trinket upgrades aren't nearly enough, and I feel like this changes teambased strategy for the worse. Some people enjoyed vision wars in yonder days past. Some people actually bought wards after they died to a gank to ensure they didn't die again. This won't impact lower elos much, but I'm fairly sure that this will cause a mess at Dia+. I'd need more information on it other than the short blurb, but I'm not a fan. On the flip side, Sightstone changes are welcome.
For potions - if the cost of HP pots goes up too much, it's going to ruin a large number of matchups. Supports are going to cry. The removal of mana potions I think is completely incorrect and will have tremendous consequences on what can and can't be played as a support, but if mana costs will be balanced around losing a support's major first purchase sustain option, it might be ok. If not, Nami might never see play again. Seriously, ever tried playing Nami without any mana potions?
On the Rift Herald, first off, it's ugly as hell. I thought it was some sort of random Void Malphite skin or something at first. Second, I'd be a bit worried about forcing too many useful objectives onto the map. At some point, objectives won't be used to draw fights, but simply to be traded, much like tier 1 towers tend to be in competitive play. Riot's been really good with neutral objectives in the past (a lot of us thought scuttle would be broken, and it turned out to be pretty cool) so I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt here... but seriously, is that not a Malphite skin? It's hideous. Balance it wisely.

And this is how everyone forgets about the fact that sandbox mode is still not mentioned. Or let alone a new client.

lmao
bye bye league it was fun playing you when you were still alive

[–]GoldenChrysus -1 points 13 days ago 
No mana pots. That's cute. So, for early game, you either need to be perfect at utilizing spells only when necessary, or you have to dump everything into mana regen masteries. Or you can forego a Doran's Ring entirely just to get a flask.

what the hell, baron nashor looks like a purple blob.

[–]SuperSaiyanSpartanKatSerious 3 points 14 days ago 
Rift Herald, not Nashor.

Baron still looks the same as before, they are adding a mob to kill before baron spawns.

[–]BusinessCashew -2 points 14 days ago 
If they're doing so much to try to make the game easier I don't know why they can't just make URF a permanent game mode. URF was the best casual MOBA I've ever played. No wards and tons of gimmicky minigames LoL just seems like it will be shitty.

[–]KbloeUIEOssa 2 points 14 days ago 
Where the fuck do you even saw the ''minigames'' and why this shitty reddit term is relevant anyway

[–]Sorenthaz -2 points 14 days ago 
Reading these patch notes and knowing that Ghostcrawler is on the team, I kept forgetting that I was reading LoL patch notes because the Mastery rework sounds a whole lot like the changes made to WoW's talent system in Mists of Pandaria.
Also Riot's tendency to throw wrenches in the game where they're not needed just for the sake of changing things is pretty much taken out of Blizzard's expansion playbook.

[–]Disneythrowawayyy -2 points 13 days ago 
Can you fucking not change corki holy shit, every champion I play the shit out of you either rework or nerf into the ground fucking done with this game, i dont care if this gets downvoted seriously done with such rapid and drastic changes ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

[–]capitalLOWERCASE[Gay Cowboy] (NA) -2 points 13 days ago 
Removing wards sounds like a mistake. I may be wrongly assuming that sightstone will also be removed too which sounds like a huge nerf to support and bot lane in general. I think it's safe to assume they want sightstone gone because that's where most of the wards in any game below diamond come from, and they want warding to be a team effort.
No one is even going to read this ahhhhhhhh

[–]RiotXypherous 4 points 13 days ago 
Sightstone will not be removed. Just the buyable green ward will be removed.

[–]capitalLOWERCASE[Gay Cowboy] (NA) 1 point 13 days ago 
Oh okay cool, thanks for the response!

[–]juiey5 -3 points 13 days ago 
That's it. I'm out.
You can have your shitty game to yourself, Riot.

[–]dennytale -3 points 13 days ago 
I hope Riot would just calm down with their updates and keep my good league of legends game the way it is. Yeah, I appreciate updates, but wtf is with these huge updates just because it is a new season. Its like a whole new different game and I have to adapt to the new features every year this is sad.

[–]bphan 4 points 13 days ago 
It's the pre season, they do it every year. This is their chance to experiment with some really weird ideas and see what it's like, without breaking the game, then when the season starts they take out a lot of the changes and keep a few of the mechanics and items that they liked.

[–]Bigwok 4 points 13 days ago 
Thats what they did every year since ever. Its the most fun playing the game in preseason when everything is fresh and people experiment what's OP and exploit them until Rito nerfed it to the ground.

[–]Hellangel72 1 point 13 days ago 
Sad ? Seriously ?

[–]dannyfanny08 -5 points 14 days ago 
Riot destroying their game and they don't even realise it.

[–]materfuze 3 points 13 days ago 
Everyone QQ's about preseason every year and its always the people that started playing on the previous season. There are always drastic changes and they always balance out, if they kept it the same forever the game would become linear and boring. I remember when they put a limit on wards and added trinkets people said warding was gone forever. Now the same shit is coming up again.

[–]FaIc0 -16 points 14 days ago 
Rip League. Had a good run. Honestly if they keep doing shit like this I can't see it last for much longer. Maybe 1-3 years?

[–]Volitaire 3 points 14 days ago 
Not a single game has been played yet and you're calling for the death of the game? Do you remember the outrage when they changed pinks? People said it was horrible for the game and would destroy the vision game, when it ended up having the exact opposite. Vision and awareness is legitimately game breaking when used correctly, it SHOULD be difficult to maintain. Give it a few months before you go calling the game dead, please.
