Nice that it doesn't require a lawyer to have it vacated, all anyone will have to do is head to the public safety building and fill out a form.

[–]Neon-Disease 252 points 1 day ago* 
Since it's no longer considered criminal conduct, can someone ELI5 why the convictions aren't just automatically tossed without a request?

[–]rachelwalexander 641 points 21 hours ago 
Hey, I'm the reporter who wrote this. Basically, throwing them out automatically requires the court to notify everyone since it's a legal matter. Many of the convictions are decades old and court records won't have updated addresses for people, which means they'd have to have their names published in the paper before the conviction could be removed. The city council initially wanted to do it automatically, but decided that publishing the names of a bunch of people in the newspaper in order to remove their convictions would kind of go against the point of the ordinance. And it would be a lot of work for the court as well.
Here's some background: http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/oct/20/spokane-considering-throwing-out-minor-pot-possess/

[–]ImAFuckingMooseBitch 134 points 20 hours ago 
Hey thanks for jumping in to clarify, reddit has a tendency to oversimplify so it's nice to see the author of a news article giving an explanation for once.

The idea of a "grammar nazi" is well understood on Reddit and no comment is required.

[–]narp7 7 points 18 hours ago 
Woah, your editor is the one who made the mistake? That's pretty funny, but also slightly concerning. Then again, I suppose if I had to read/edit so many pages of material each day, I would be bound to make a few mistakes.

[–]rachelwalexander 8 points 17 hours ago 
Well, my editor actually wrote the short story today about the council passing the thing. I wrote the longer story I linked to in my first comment explaining the details and did more of the background/research on this.

[–]narp7 1 point 13 hours ago 
Ah, that makes sense.

[–]SnarkyFartBlast 7 points 18 hours ago 
Thanks for clarifying. Tell your boss I told them to give you a raise. Now if we can get more reporters to come on and interact with the stories written and field questions here, wouldn't that be a hoot. A mini AMA?

[–]rachelwalexander 7 points 17 hours ago 
I would love to do that with stories I write. It's awesome to know people are reading your work and have questions about it. But Spokane news doesn't usually pick up a ton of national attention, sadly, unless it's for something weird.

[–]pppooollloooppp 3 points 20 hours ago 
Why do they need to be published in the newspaper in the first place?

[–]rachelwalexander 8 points 19 hours ago 
To notify people that legal action is being taken which will affect them. State law requires them in a number of circumstances, for things like notifying potential heirs if someone dies without a will, for instance.

[–]ThinkInAbstract 7 points 19 hours ago 
That all seems very reasonable, and in glad they didn't publicize it.
There'd be a shitstorm on reddit if they did. "Spokane publishes lists of pot offenders to clear pot offender list."
Then there'd be a circlejerk about how counterintuitive that was and herpa derpy doo

[–]vroom23 1 point 19 hours ago 
Why is there a distinction between the municipal court and the District court? Is it similar to city government vs County Government? If it is, why were these eligible convictions not tried at the county level?

[–]rachelwalexander 1 point 17 hours ago 
Here's a basic explanation: https://www.courts.wa.gov/newsinfo/resources/?fa=newsinfo_jury.display&altMenu=Citi&folderID=jury_guide&fileID=limited
Basically, muni courts handle local ordinance violations while district courts do state law. So misdemeanor marijuana convictions from district court aren't covered here.

[–]Tron22 1 point 19 hours ago 
Nice work author.

[–]intensely_human 1 point 18 hours ago 
So basically the logistics don't work out. It's still interesting that by "automatic" that constrains them into notification and publishing. In theory all an "automatic" removal of a previous conviction should involve is some big delete query on a database somewhere.
Even if the person doesn't know, they're now expunged. Some people might be checking that misdemeanor box on applications even though they don't have to, but that's no worse than the previous situation.

[–]Neon-Disease 1 point 18 hours ago 
I think the effort to erase these cases should be made by the prosecutors/police who so eagerly sought these convictions in the first place.
Sort of a "fix the mess you made" type of thing.

Hey Rachel, any idea if any other Washington Courts are going to follow suit?

[–]rachelwalexander 2 points 17 hours ago 
I haven't heard of anything specifically. The WA legislature was considering a bill to do this statewide, but it died in committee last session. Wouldn't surprise me if Seattle follows suit, though. And Oregon has something similar going on: http://seattle.cbslocal.com/2015/09/29/oregon-expunging-marijuana-violations-from-citizens-records/

[–]MrSilkyJohnson 47 points 21 hours ago 
More specifically, a lot of city offices still rely on SOME paper records, as well as a digital collection, so they have to use their resources efficiently to search both.
Yes, it would great if they could just do:
BEGIN TRANSACTION

DELETE 
    c
FROM
    Conviction c
    INNER JOIN Severity s on s.ID = c.Severity
    INNER JOIN Charge ch on ch.ID = c.Charge
WHERE
    s.SeverityType = 'Misdemeanor'
    AND ch.Name = 'Possession/Marijuana'

COMMIT TRANSACTION

Precisely. Writing that in SQL assumes all sorts of internal workings. It should be:
http DELETE /api/convictions/batch_destroy headers: severity='misdemeanor' contains='marijuana possession'
Wrap that shitty old database in a simple interface. Sorry I don't know what the route is for a RESTful batch delete.

I've always read it in my head as "ess queue el", never actually heard it spoken.

[–]orphanitis 2 points 19 hours ago 
Most people say it like "sequel". Which I guess rolls off the tongue better than "ess q el". However, I've always read it as "ess q el" and will probably pronounce it that way until someone makes fun of me. Haha

[–]JustARandomBloke 65 points 23 hours ago 
Not a lawyer, but my understanding is that since it was a crime when you committed it you are still liable.
For example, you shoot an animal on the endangered species list, the next day it is removed from the list. You would still be liable for hunting an endangered animal.

[–]5858butseriously 63 points 23 hours ago 
The problem I have with this logic is that in the case of something like a misdemeanor marijuana charge, the law was revoked because it was decided it shouldn't be a crime in the first place.
In the endangered species example there's a fundamental difference in that the status of the animal can fluctuat, whereas smoking some pot just shouldn't be a crime.

[–]Highside79 25 points 22 hours ago 
The law that was passed was not "this should never have been illegal". It was "this is legal now". Laws aren't retroactive. That is a pretty important part of the US legal system and it keeps them from making things illegal after the fact.

[–]Victoria7474 22 points 21 hours ago 
Actually... the court systems get to pick and choose which laws to enforce and consider retroactive. Edit: adding Calder v. Bull wiki

[–]_My_Angry_Account_ 4 points 20 hours ago 
Don't forget California's retroactive tax.

[–]chitownghost 3 points 19 hours ago 
there are a lot of laws that are retroactive

[–]Highside79 1 point 19 hours ago 
Can you give us some examples? I am aware of sex-offender registration laws which passed through the supreme court with some controversy. Are there are others?

[–]chitownghost 2 points 19 hours ago 
they used to give people more time for selling crack as opposed to powder cocaine. they changed the law and made it retroactive. my best friends mom was released on this, that's the only reason I know. I also don't know if it was federal or state. I didn't mean to say lots, I would have to look up if there is more

[–]gillandgolly 2 points 18 hours ago 
Generally, it is not considered problematic if a law has a retroactive effect that is exclusively benign.
For example, Alan Turing was posthumously pardoned in 2013. This was a gesture by the UK state to demonstrate that the state had done wrong by him in terms of legislation. Obviously, he had, by this time, become a national hero, and there were thousands of men who suffered the same treatment. I believe that this caused some discussion of the opportunity of other gay men to have their records cleared.
Obviously, by this time, homosexuality had been legal in the UK for 45 years, and most "offenders" were old age pensioners. And, considering the evolution of social attitudes, many had probably come to wear their criminal convictions as badges of honor.
If you dig around, you’ll find a few examples of retroactive benefits of legalization. There should be many more to come. If one is to take the spirit of representative democracy seriously, then laws are made for the people, by the people, to protect the people. The agents of the people - the courts, law enforcement, and public archives - should be able to make "offenders" that we have come to recognize as wrongfully punished, whole again.
By "wrongfully punished" I do not mean falsely convicted, but punished under unjust laws. We easily recognize that the laws of non-Western regimes can be unjust, and that convictions of having broken them should be entirely disregarded or even seen as a badge of honor.

Every time Disney buys a new copyright law, Mickey Mouse stays out of the public domain for a few more years.

[–]Stormflux 1 point 20 hours ago 
Seems like those "problems" are easily fixed.
Repeals aren't automatically retroactive? Put language in there saying this one is.
Worried that you might criminalize something ex-post facto? Good thing we're doing the opposite here.
Honestly these things sound more like excuses than actual problems.

[–]airodonack 20 points 23 hours ago 
It's not about how OK something is, but it's more about respect for the law. Nobody should be able to pick and choose which laws they feel like following. If you disagree with a law, you're supposed to go through legislation first.

[–]JustARandomBloke 26 points 23 hours ago 
Or you accept the consequences a la civil disobedience.

[–]lunartree 6 points 22 hours ago 
I'm sure that sounds all great and edgy until your criminal record automatically disqualifies you for a job.

[–]PM_ME_UR_OBSIDIAN 24 points 22 hours ago 
American society comes down a bit too hard on felons, and as a result the democratic process of civil disobedience is hampered.
I'm sure there could be a way to fix this, but it starts with rethinking America's relationship with criminals.

[–]Neon-Disease 2 points 18 hours ago

[–]whatsinaname007 0 points 13 hours ago 
Absolutely. It's not right that any crime whether misdemeanor or felony should be a life sentence. Once your debt is paid, it should be your business and no one else's.

[–]IAmA_Risky_Click_AMA 1 point 21 hours ago 
This also doesn't apply to felony marijuana charges.

[–]intensely_human 2 points 18 hours ago 
Someone mentioning civil disobedience isn't trying to be edgy; they're just talking about what is and what goes on.
In a legal system, the choice always exists to break the law and consciously take the consequences. Just fact.

[–]ThisIsNotYourGrave 2 points 18 hours ago 
"Edgy" You do understand that Civil Disobedience is what starts the process of revoking terrible laws, right? Prohibition would probably still be around if it weren't for hundreds of thousands engaging in civil disobedience by going to speakeasies, smuggling alcohol, or making it themselves. Not to mention the mob.
It's the same with weed. It's taken A LOT of good individuals behind bars or buying, selling, and smoking weed illegally to get us to where we are now. Sure, people who have NEVER broken the law play a part, too, but that firsthand experience of smoking weed really helps to solidify just how harmless it is. I think there is a stat out there that says 46% of Americans have tried marijuana at least once. You can bet that a good percentage of that group would not have thought to get the laws changed if they hadn't first engaged in civil disobedience.

respect for the law.
Nobody who has seen legislative bodies in action can possibly have any reasonable respect for the law. What actually ends up enshrined in law is basically a crapshoot that might see many legislators absent, and even fewer of the legislators will have read the bills themselves. Nobody really believes that because the Democrats needed Republican votes to increase a tax by 1%, and put in a line about gambling at home being illegal as a compromise to get Republican votes, that means that gambling at home should be illegal. It's just what happened to pass a bill. But suddenly it's the law of the land. Even if it was thrown in at the last minute and never really deliberated. Even if people who already signed off on the bill don't really care or know it was added, and disagree with it, but are willing to vote it through anyway so that their pet bill passes.
It's basically just a system that people tolerate because political people value political power over legislative meaningfulness and we aren't given many alternatives. But you can't be a sane person and "respect" that kind of haphazard, zero-science-and-accountability system or its products.

[–]airodonack 0 points 21 hours ago 
That haphazard system built the American hegemony. Honestly, some of the laws are stupid only because it reflects some of the stupidity of the voting base.
We are seeing changes to marijuana legalization as it becomes more accepted, so you can't say it doesn't work. In my state, weed is legal recreationally because most of our voters believe that it should be legal. Legalization through legislation works.

[–]Stormflux 1 point 20 hours ago* 
Yeah, it works, but why is it so slow? This should have been done 30 years ago, and even now many states still have it illegal. Need I remind you that we're still waiting on universal health care? And last but not least, remember what happened to Athens.

[–]airodonack 1 point 19 hours ago 
It's slow because for a long time, the majority of voters actually believed that marijuana was harmful to society. We're starting to see changes, though. You can look at this map of gay marriage legalization to get a good idea of what lies in the future: http://graphics.latimes.com/usmap-gay-marriage-chronology/

[–]Stormflux 1 point 18 hours ago 
I know, I was alive in the 80's. I wonder though: why did voters believe marijuana was so scary? A simple Google search should be all it takes to show that it's not. Of course, we didn't have Google... but still, the information had to come from somewhere. I'm actually having trouble remembering where we got information from back then. TV and DARE, I think?
So, what you're saying is, the very special episode of Family Matters that was meant to save families, is indirectly responsible for the biggest destruction of families that America has seen?

continue this thread
[–]mc_blubberson 12 points 22 hours ago* 
I do respect the law. When its sensible. Just because the law states that we shouldn't smoke pot doesn't stop pot smokers. I, just like many stoners, don't care. Not to mention, you say nobody should be able to choose which laws they follow. I dont know if you are aware, but VERY few people pick and choose which laws are WRITTEN. The American public never voted for marijuana to be illegal. We are simply told thats how it is. Just because a book states it's illegal doesnt mean anything in the minds of smokers. It simply forces us to be secretive about it. All prohibition has done is waste our money, ruin lives, and people still smoke pot in growing numbers. I understand your opinion, I intensely disagree with it.

[–]airodonack 4 points 22 hours ago 
I see what you're trying to say, but there are people out there that believe stealing alcohol should be legal because they want free alcohol. I'm not making this up. If their opinions on the "Don't Steal Alcohol" law is retarded, then maybe our opinions on a law may also be retarded. (I agree marijuana should be decriminalized btw). That's why we have a legislature. We need the majority to agree on how we run a government before we enact or repeal laws.
So about legislature. Public opinion has way, way more sway to law makers than you believe. If you want evidence, look at growing acceptance of marijuana usage and the places where it's starting to become legal. It's already recreationally legal in 2 states. And more states are considering it all the time. In 10 years, mj will probably be legal federally. The only reason marijuana is still illegal in so many states? The people who believe it should be legal don't fucking vote. Guess who votes? Aunt Edna with ten cats and a medieval opinion on gay marriage. Who doesn't vote anywhere but online polls on mj legalization? Steve whose "votes, like, don't even matter, man". (Translation: I'm too goddamn lazy to put on pants and make my community a better place.)
I believe that certain drugs are harmless and should be legalized. But I may also be wrong. If we're going to make a law that affects all of us, then it's a decision the majority will have to make. It's not a decision that individuals make for the majority.

[–]legalize-drugs 1 point 19 hours ago 
No, you're not wrong. It's really obvious that certain drugs in particular should be legalized, and all of them should be decriminalized. Look into the root of marijuana prohibition sometime. It's intensely corrupt, and involved a big, fat lie, that the AMA supported criminalizing it, when in fact they did not.
The real reason weed is being legalized? Brave people who care about their lives and enjoy this wonderful drug risked their freedom to grow it and sell it. We care about our lives, and we have basic morality and can see that we live in a psychotic society that does stuff like liking people in cages for using harmless and joyous plants.
Same thing with psychedelics. I'm not going to stop eating mushrooms because some extremely ignorant and often corrupt legislators who have never eaten mushrooms before say that I shouldn't. I care about my life, and can think for myself. So can you.

[–]airodonack 1 point 18 hours ago 
I don't mean to disparage your movement, but people grow marijuana because it makes a ton of money to do so. I don't think ethics or morality has anything to do with it.
No, the evidence is in the polls about mj attitudes. Look here, dated 2013: http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx. Notice that the article says first time. There may be a few producers who push for mj legalization, but the vast majority of proponents are and will always be the users and the people.
MJ is being legalized because people don't think it's bad anymore. That's the real reason. People thought it was bad, but now they don't. Whether or not you believe that politicians are corrupt, political change is happening and it's happening at the same time that marijuana attitudes are evolving.

[–]legalize-drugs 1 point 18 hours ago 
People don't think it's bad anymore because they've smoked it themselves or know someone who has. That's the point. Thank you to the growers and dealers, as well as to the political activists for all their hard work. The change didn't just miraculously happen. I've been very involved in the legalization movement, and I can tell you how much hard work has gone into it.

People did choose the laws. It's a representative democracy. It's silly to think there should be a popular vote about everything.

[–]legalize-drugs 1 point 19 hours ago 
On the contrary, I think the ballot initiative process is very important. Regular people are often way ahead of legislators. This is the way that we've gotten drug policy reform measures such as weed legalization passed.

Who defines what is sensible?
Because there was a time when slavery was sensible because blacks weren't really "people".
There was also a time when women weren't given voting rights, because they couldn't think with that Tiny Female Brain of theirs.
There was also a time (really, really recently) when people were vehemently opposed to gay marriage because it's just wrong and against our biological nature.
So who defines what is sensible? Are you the authority on what is or isn't sensible?

I really doubt going in and signing a piece of paper that says, "This isn't fair" would have helped the Jews. You can see from 50 years of protest, legal blocking, political and special interest funded propaganda and there still not being a single place in this country where it's actually LEGAL, not "decriminalized", but actual legalization of marijuana in all forms, you can see how "you're supposed to go through legislation" is a bullshit comment. This system has failed us.

[–]jello1388 4 points 20 hours ago 
It's not decriminalized in Colorado or Washington. It's legal on a state level. Decriminalized means users are not persecuted and the laws are on the books but not enforced for sale. It is flat out legal as far as Washington and Colorado state are concerned. They collect tax money on it, and regulate the industry. Sure, the federal law disagrees, but there is legislation that is turning around.

[–]Aegis_Holder 1 point 18 hours ago 
That's the rub, though - anything that is illegal at the federal level cannot be legal at the state level. States are only allowed to form laws that are not expressly forbidden by the federal government.

[–]jello1388 1 point 17 hours ago 
True, federal law supercedes state law. It doesnt forbid states from making whatever laws they want, though. It would have to be challenged in court, and in the interim federal law enforcement can still go in and bust people. Its really going to get messy at some point unless we are incredibly lucky.
The point was that there is in fact legislation starting to take place for full legaliziation. Public opinion is shifting. The majority being against marijuana prohibition was only a few years ago. It will take time for legislation to catch up. On top of it, a couple legalization measures have failed because they were hot garbage, such as Ohio.
I think Washington kind of got a crap deal, and Colorado's isnt perfect either, but they are still hugely important and a really big step in the right direction. They are counterpoints to the failure of prohibition right here on American soil. The pessimistic attitude doesn't help and ignores a ton of progress.

[–]Aegis_Holder 2 points 17 hours ago 
The only way for marijuana to be legal in the country is if it is legal at the federal level. So long as it remains illegal at the federal level, NO state can pass ANY laws making it legal. It's not only that federal law supersedes state law, it's that states cannot form any laws that the federal government has forbidden. Said another way, states are free to form any laws they want, only if it doesn't go against any federal laws.

This system has failed us.
The legal system is slow. Nobody is going to argue that. It has to take time to catch up to social change: on race, on gender equality, on gay rights, and now on marijuana. The social movement occurs first, and if the tide is strong enough the legislature gets involved, with the judicial system often finishing up last.
Big Pharma, as well as Alcohol and Tobacco industries all have fairly strong interests to keep marijuana illegal. I wouldn't be surprised if many employees in the DEA had stocks or investments in those industries.
What I'm saying is: the legal system is really just trying to catch up. Give it time. States had to initiate change first before the Supreme Court (fed gov) stepped in to say anything about it. In 10 years we likely will see legalization, barring some tragic event like Donald Trump becoming President.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 19 hours ago 
Agree completely. There is no adequate channel to change the laws.
At the state level, I can petition to get ANYTHING I want onto the next election. I need 100k signatures in my state, and it automatically goes onto the next election, it doesn't matter how much my state government hates it.
Then, if 50% of the voters say yes, it becomes law. The state government has no oversight on this.
At the federal level, there is no such apparatus to change substance scheduling laws. Additionally, they ignore duly passed state laws.
So yeah the system has failed. And people are paying with their freedom.

[–]airodonack 1 point 21 hours ago 
You can't say that legislation doesn't work because it is working in America. Attitudes towards marijuana is changing this country. It has only started to become accepted outside of stoner circles, and people are starting to realize it for the harmless drug that it is. Already two states have legalized it recreationally. More are considering it all the time. We may see federal legalization in 10 years.
Here's how fast we did it with gay marriage: http://graphics.latimes.com/usmap-gay-marriage-chronology/ Imagine that, except we're already on two states. That only happened, because the majority started to believe that gay marriage really wasn't so bad.
Now about Hitler and MLK. The laws we are talking about there actively harmed large segments of the population. Marijuana? You can't seriously tell me that taking a joint out of your hands is as bad as segregation or Auschwitz.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 19 hours ago 
Yeah, it only took this long because the government falsified several studies and made it illegal to submit new studies that overturned their false studies.
Without the internet there would be another 100 years of prohibition.
They lied to your face and faked scientific studies to fit the policy they wanted...google: "Cannabis College of Virginia Nixon"

I wonder if there's any chance 20 or 30 years from now bringing to trial officials who set that kind of scheduling and resulted in so many prisoners doing hard time over it. It does seem like upper level officials are kind of above the law, and the current crop of Baby Boomers and GenXer voters seem to be all okay with it, but there's always that chance the Millenials and their kids, who are going to become more connected to injustices and corruption through the social media of the 2020s and 2030s, might not go for "business as usual" anymore and might seek to restore integrity in government. At least it is possible.

" "Never forget the everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.""
I don't know if he said that, but it isn't true. In fact, hitler broke many of Germany's laws. Also, comparing marijuana laws to what MLK Jr was talking about or what Hitler did is pretty disgusting and makes you look like a moron. You aren't a moron, stop acting like one.
"This system has failed us."
Because it doesn't give you what you personally want, doesn't mean it's failed.

"This system has failed us."
You are part of the system, and if you haven't been engaging your representatives, you have failed you.
Have YOU spoken to your congressman? Any representative?
I have. I was involved, can't help but notice it's going to be legal in my state, and I can't hep but notice more federal level representative pushing to get this changed.
YOu want to be a lazy quitter who never does anything besides make excuses? fine. But I won't sit here quietly while you try to blame 'the system' when you do nothing.
There are American who think it should be illegal. You may disagree with them, but they still have the right to that opinion. Many of these people are also involved in communities and politics. Notice it's there voice the gets heard the loudest? Because you and your stoner friends can't be bothered.

We're all criminals. A new law is passed in the USA every 72 hours. Be it at a regional level or national. How many new laws are repealed every 72 hours? It's a much lower number. Ever had a cop do the walk-around on your vehicle to see what he can write you a ticket for? That's one scenario.

[–]inpu 1 point 21 hours ago* 
How do you feel about people who were arrested for being gay and having gay sex? Sometimes, the law is simply wrong. In fact, the law has absolutely no value in itself. It is just a means to an end for preventing suffering. Whenever a law doesn't serve that end, and in fact causes suffering, such as sodomy laws or drug prohibition, it is absolutely moral to ignore it.

[–]airodonack 1 point 20 hours ago 
There are issues that are worth the civil disobedience, jail time, and rebellion. Marijuana legalization, at least in my opinion, is not one of those things.

[–]legalize-drugs 1 point 19 hours ago 
It obviously is, since any thinking person should see that one shouldn't be locked in a cage for smoking a harmless plant, and civil disobedience is inherent to just using it in most places. The laws won't change unless we keep using it, and it's a joyous thing, so we're going to keep using it.

[–]chillin223 1 point 14 hours ago 
You literally just said no one should pick and choose and then you say that there are somethings that we should pick.

[–]airodonack 1 point 11 hours ago 
That's true. That's pretty hypocritical. Here's what I believe from an emotional standpoint:
I'm more empathetic towards people like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X, who used civil disobedience as a tool to help others. In contrast, I don't have the same sympathy for drug dealers currently in jail, who used civil disobedience as a tool to make money.
I believe that the fight for marijuana legalization, while it should be legal, isn't worth going to jail for. If anything, it IS worth going to jail for the good and otherwise innocent people who are already incarcerated for posession. But that's not why people deal drugs. It isn't a form of protest, and it's certainly not selfless. That's why I don't agree with it.
Thank you for challenging my views.

[–]powerfunk 1 point 20 hours ago

I don't agree. If a law gets removed because the majority doesn't agree with it, then it's apparent that law had no bearing to begin with.
"Respect for the law" is so arbitrary. What I get from that is, "Conform." I'm no anarchist or anything, but that just doesn't sit right with me.
I hold respect for the law, but I respect my own values and common sense more so. And I realize plenty of people will take that statement and run for the hills with it, which is why I think discussions like this are necessary.

[–]RPrevolution 1 point 22 hours ago 
If you only respect law that corresponds with morality, then you are an anarchist.

[–]airodonack 1 point 21 hours ago 
I agree that "respect for the law" sounds too authoritarian. It is easier to swallow depending on what you believe the purpose of laws are. I see them as rules meant to protect the people. Therefore, it might be more accurate to say, "respect for the people". But that statement is confusing and really easy to interpret differently. For example, I believe the people should be able to do X, so I will ignore law prohibiting X.

This is the whole ex-post-facto thing. So a new law making it legal does not automatically expunge previous convictions.

[–]Highside79 3 points 22 hours ago 
It was still a crime when you committed the offence, which means that you knowingly committed a crime.

The question wasn't "why shouldn't the convictions be automatically tossed", frankly I think they should be. The question is why aren't they being reversed. My statement is correct. It is not an argument, it is a statement of fact. There is no false dichotomy here. The reason I gave is the reason it is happening. Whether that is the best way of doing it or not is immaterial to the question that was asked.

[–]swuboo 1 point 17 hours ago 
There is no false dichotomy here.
There is, actually, because the two things are treated completely differently in our legal system.
If Congress or a state legislature wanted to eliminate a crime and void all convictions for it, they have every right to do so. If they wanted to create a new crime and penalize everyone who'd committed it while it was legal, they're barred from doing so by the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.
The reason I gave is the reason it is happening.
It isn't, actually. Per the commenter who claims to have written the story, the reason it's being done this way is simply to avoid having to publish the names of everyone involved in the paper to meet notification requirements for the vacations. Spokane could simply automatically vacate all the convictions if it wanted to.

[–]Highside79 1 point 17 hours ago 
This is a municipal government, not a state or federal government, they may not have the legislative authority to do as you suggest.

[–]swuboo 1 point 17 hours ago 
While that's certainly possible (though it doesn't seem to be the case,) if true it would be a lack of authority—not because it opens to the door to ex post facto punishment, as you suggested.
It doesn't, any more than the fact that judges can overturn guilty verdicts—they can—opens the door to overturning not guilty verdicts—they can't.

No, you shouldn't, and we should accept obvious progress such as marijuana legalization and drug decriminalization generally. Society has been disgustingly ass backwards on this, and it's time to move forward. Smoking weed is not a crime; it's a repulsive approach based on some major lies, including the original lie fed to Congress, which is that the AMA supported its criminalization, when in fact they didn't.

Exactly. The fact that "well it should have never been illegal in the first place" doesn't absolve you of the crime you did in fact commit while it was illegal. Just because you don't believe it should be illegal doesn't change that.

First of all, the founding fathers were mostly alcoholic 20 years old. They were intellectuals, but let's not pretend that everything that came out of their mouths was gospel. 200 years of development in case law and statutory law seems to indicate that while they proposed a good foundation, it's needed a lot of tweaking since then.
Second: I'm not saying that laws shouldn't be overturned -- where they are unjust and/or social justice prevails, then a change in the law is appropriate. In fact, I've been a supporter of de-scheduling marijuana and legalizing it across the country since Colorado and Washington set that precedent and made an idea a potentially feasible reality.
What I'm getting at is that, at the time, there existed a law, you broke the law, and in the rules of the society we live in, when you break a law, you suffer the consequences. There are ways to go about changing the law without needing to break it. I've never smoked weed, never purchased it (black market or retail), never sold it. And yet I've chosen to work with local state government officials to influence the regulations that are being established in my state. I could try to drive social change by ripping a bong - but that's illegal and I understand that I could face consequences from it. I might not agree with the law, but I agreed to live in this society and abide by those rules.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 13 hours ago 
I maintain that it is immoral to make "toking a bong" illegal. The government is going to break into your house in the middle of the night and kidnap you, for something that doesn't harm anyone? And the laws are based on falsified studies. Can you explain to me how this is moral?
The government isn't the ultimate arbiter of morality. Sometimes, when they cross the line and start putting people in jail for disagreeing with them, you say "Fuck you, you are wrong" to them.
Have fun working with state legislatures - the feds will overturn state law, which is immoral to do.
The system is a corrupt failure driven by profits and power. This is not the only issue I'm passionate about, but it's a good example of the punishment not fitting the crime.
In fact, black's law dictionary defines "crime" as:
1) Having real harm
2) Having an injured party
Neither of those are present when someone "rips a bong". So why are we kidnapping and imprisoning people for it?
Either you believe in liberty, or you don't. You, 90sChick, don't.

[–]ImA90sChick 1 point 12 hours ago 
Have fun working with state legislatures - the feds will overturn state law, which is immoral to do.
Well, they haven't in two years and they aren't expected to. And also, I'm not sure where you get the idea that it's somehow immoral? With the way the gov is built technically this is within the rights of the fed gov. Whether those rights are appropriate or not rests on whether or not you are a strong advocate for modern-day federalism.
I'm not sure where you get that I don't believe in liberty? I believe in advocating social change. I believe in doing so by the books. If you're angry and you decide to burn a city down, nobody will take your cause seriously. If you're angry and you decide to protest outside of city hall and draft petitions and gather signatures and go to local county meetings and submit proposals and actually do the work to make change happen, then people take you seriously.
I'm sorry, I really don't understand how we fell into an argument about moral v. immoral. This conversation started with the fact that if there is a law, and you break it, then you suffer the consequences. I wrote this in another comment, but suppose you jaywalk. Jaywalking is against the law (at least in my city). I get a ticket for $54, and even if I fundamentally believe that jaywalking is morally right (or at the very least, not immoral), I still have to pay the damn ticket. Even if tomorrow, or next week, or ten years from now the law is overturned, it doesn't change the fact that when it was illegal to jaywalk, I still did it. I pay the consequences. There is no subject of moral/immoral here, it's literally all based in fact or law.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 11 hours ago

[–]legalize-drugs 1 point 18 hours ago 
No, I've done absolutely nothing wrong in smoking weed throughout my life. Nothing wrong at all; in fact, it's been great. I'm sure you can see that. The law is CORRUPT, and we were systematically lied to about it. The RIGHT thing to do is to call this bullshit out and move forward as a society, just as Rosa Parks did, in an obvious example. same with psychedelics.
You can think for yourself. You can have basic morality. You don't need to rely on a corrupt government to do it for you.

"Bad" law is just too relative. The laws are there to obey, if enough people don't think they are good, then the laws are changed. A good person obeys the laws of the country he is a part of... we don't need to rebel and overthrow just to get a law changed.

[–]Kwangone 3 points 23 hours ago 
I obey the spirit of the law. I don' t obey the letter of the law. "Bad" law in this case is a law that is fundamentally unconstitutional and unnecessarily punishes a certain subsect of the population. Law as a concept is there to find a baseline we can all agree upon. Generation by generation this should be rethought. These are not universal laws. I never said anything about overthrowing anything, but "rebel"? Yes. Get sponsored by funyons and oreos and stage the stufidest rebellion ever. Everyone who smokes weed just admit it and do it so that we can move on to more important issues.

[–]ImA90sChick 1 point 11 hours ago 
"Bad" law in this case is a law that is fundamentally unconstitutional and unnecessarily punishes a certain subsect of the population.
First, consuming marijuana is not a constitutional right. It is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Constitution that citizens of the U.S. are allowed to consume marijuana. This is not dependent on your reading of the Constitution. This is not a Con-law issue.
Second, the prohibition of marijuana doesn't in the express terms of the law punish a certain subsect of the population. If your unconstitutional argument rests of the fact that the prohibition of marijuana specifically targets people of a lower-economic status or of a particular race - scientifically, you may be right. But in terms of the way the law is written, it is not targeted at or specifically calls to punish any particular class or portion of the population. It is a rule across the board that in theory would be enforced equally whether you had $5 to your name or were Bill Gates himself. In practice, this doesn't occur for a lot of reasons. But a textual reading of the law gives no indication that it targets a particular portion of the population.
If this is the definition we use for bad law, then the prohibition on marijuana is not bad law. And it wasn't - it did what it was intended to do (criminalize marijuana). The issue is that it was ineffective and created more problems than it solved. This doesn't mean the law was bad, just that times have changed and that the law needs to adapt with social change, technological change, progress in the scientific world, etc.
There are avenues by which to modify or repeal those laws that don't involve breaking them.

[–]Kwangone 1 point 11 hours ago 
Pursuit of happiness is more the Declaration of Independence, but still relevent. As far as breaking shit laws is concerned: we may disagree. I think people should just go out and smoke weed in the streets so that this country can get over this pious stigmatized anomaly. We have bigger analogies to fry.

[–]ManganeseOxide 1 point 23 hours ago 
True. I don't believe it should be a crime to smoke weed. Although I don't personally agree with it. The crime was getting caught. And honestly if one makes the decision and risk getting caught, shouldn't one suffer the consequences of their actions?

"If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so." -Thomas Jefferson

[–]ImA90sChick 1 point 11 hours ago 
So what is your definition of a law that is unjust?

[–]sonofherb 1 point 9 hours ago* 
If it were that easy to define, why wouldn't we just design a system that precluded laws meeting those parameters from ever being even considered? Fact is that it's messy territory there - too messy to sum up cleanly, and if I did that'd still only be my personal take on it.
A law could be impractical or impossible to enforce, outdated and/or obviated by contemporary knowledge and sensibilities, or could perhaps have had unintended consequences compelling people to change it.
Laws have to be changeable. That's why that function was (very deliberately) built into the architecture of the US government.

[–]ManganeseOxide -3 points 22 hours ago 
I dont think making weed a controlled substance was unjust. So who decides that it's unjust? Or do we just get to pick and choose?

[–]Phyltre 1 point 22 hours ago 
Yes, that's referred to as free will. You get to choose your own actions. If you do what the law says just because the law says to do it, you are a shell of a person who has abdicated their moral responsibility in exchange for constancy.

There's nothing holy about the law.

[–]JohnROCKER_49 1 point 21 hours ago 
Basically there is. Either you follow the law and you stay out of trouble OR you repeatedly break the law and pray you never get caught or face the repercussions. They don't care about your personal beliefs about the law, they will still hold you accountable based on them.

[–]Phyltre 1 point 20 hours ago 
By that logic, rattlesnakes are equally holy:
Either you stay away from them and don't get bitten or you play with them and pray you don't get bitten. They don't care about whether you're friendly, they will still hold you accountable to rattlesnake standards of biting.

[–]ImA90sChick 1 point 12 hours ago 
Your analogy fails in so many regards - perhaps a different explanation might help.
By living in the U.S. (or any country, I'm just using the U.S. as an example), and in particular your city/county/state, you have "signed" a social contract to abide by the rules that govern the citizens of that city/county/state. Now obviously you haven't signed anything, but it is an implicit social agreement that we'll all try to live by these rules because we agree with them, they work, they make our lives better, etc. It's also understood that if we don't agree with the laws, or they become irrelevant due to changes in technology or social attitudes or lifestyles, then we have avenues by which to repeal those laws or make new ones.
By living in this city/county/state, and by agreeing to the rules that govern the people who live in that city/county/state, you also agree to the repercussion by not following those rules. I mean, you have a job, right? You have workplace rules. And if you don't follow the rules, you are likely to be fired. Same basic principle applies here. One of the repercussions might be jail time: because you have shown that you don't want to live by rules we've established and decided were appropriate for our time/age/lifestyle/whatever, we'll take you out of society for a little bit, but maybe let you come back if you've demonstrated that you can be a functioning member again (sorry, this is more ELI5 but it's the easiest way to explain it).
So you break a rule, you knew you broke a rule, and you face the repercussions. There's nothing moral, or immoral, or holy/unholy about this system. It's literally just a set of basic life rules that you are asked to follow, and if you don't want to follow them you can (a) change the rules, (b) be removed from society until you can show that you are willing to abide by the rules, or (c) move elsewhere.

[–]JohnROCKER_49 -1 points 20 hours ago 
First, neither are holy lets go ahead and throw that out there. Second, guess what I don't play with because I don't want to get bit? A snake that is known to be poisonous and that bites often just for touching it or getting close.

[–]JohnROCKER_49 [score hidden] 7 minutes ago 
I do, but until they are changed, they are still laws. You do realize that don't you? And that any law you break, has repercussions when broken.

If my boss tells me to run my hand through a tablesaw then I say no and quit my job. How is that illogical? I will support and defend laws created to defend people's rights. I will work in a competent and supportive manner anytime that makes sense. When someone else decides to introduce counterproductive rules or regulations I will calmly argue against those rules and regulations. I do not have ill-will toward those who are my superiors through the merit of their work, but I do, and always will, reserve the right to disagree. If there is a conflict of interest or belief I am always willing to negotiate, or politely walk away. If there is not a rational discourse available then I will, and do, reserve the right to tell any "entity", be it a corporation, an individual, or a government to kindly go fuck themselves.

[–]JohnROCKER_49 -1 points 20 hours ago 
That is literally the worst analogy in the world. You don't want to listen to common sense, thats fine.

[–]wigglewam 7 points 20 hours ago 
I'm fairly certain this is incorrect.
If a record is expunged, it is physically erased so that there is no trace of it. If a record is vacated, there is still a record of the conviction and then a record of it being vacated. You don't have to report it on job applications and such, but it does exist.

[–]avboden[S] 2 points 17 hours ago 
ah...right you are just looked it up. Thanks edited the comment.

[–]nssdrone 1 point 16 hours ago 
You don't have to report it on job applications and such, but it does exist.
And will still be used against you on the job hiring process, even if they say they aren't. This is an at-will state, they can decline to hire you for no good reason at all. So if a company is looking for perfect citizens, they will still see this arrest, and even though it has been vacated, it will be used against you.

[–]wigglewam 1 point 16 hours ago 
i agree with your point that if employers see the conviction, that may (consciously or unconsciously) affect your chances. though in most cases, i suspect it will have no influence because they won't see it at all.
for the vast majority of jobs (government jobs excepted) it's not required to do a criminal background check. so if you don't report it, they won't see it. it's not illegal to hire someone with a criminal record and it costs an employer money to run a background check.
of course for government jobs, you will probably be rejected because it is still a federal crime.

[–]kublan 1 point 12 hours ago 
For an adult there will always be a trace of it, because the arrest record was released to the public shortly after the arrest.

Too bad the state can't undo the massive amount of money/manpower wasted to acquire these convictions, or the human suffering that resulted from them.

[–]mecderder 0 points 15 hours ago 
woe woe woe you are going a little to far there saying that they are throwing away their lives. i do not think that the war in the middle east should have happened / happening, but it is. the soldiers who are fighting their might not even have had a choice such as the case would have been if they enlisted before the war started, they have a contract of normally more than 2 years to fulfill. however the people who joined afterwards is another story.

[–]HelpingOutPops 2 points 21 hours ago 
That's not completely true. In Washington state, background checks turn up all kinds of non-conviction data so employers will still see that you were arrested and charged for it, and then they'll see that the conviction was vacated. You'll still have to explain yourself.

[–]sporkbox 2 points 9 hours ago 
Honestly, that's another thing that needs to be gotten rid of. Employers have no right to that information unless they deal with the government and require a certain clearance.
Once someone has committed a crime and completed their sentencing, their "debt to society" is paid. There's no legitimate reason to make someone suffer after that point.

[–]nssdrone 1 point 16 hours ago 
I know, it's freaking crazy. Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty? A prospective employer can see that you were charged, and found innocent, and still choose to not hire you. YES those companies do exist.

[–]HelpingOutPops 2 points 14 hours ago 
They absolutely do. It's very unfair. In Washington state, the law forbids considering any criminal records older than 10 years, which helps in some cases but not others.
Very large companies hire reporting agencies to do the legwork on background checks. This is advantageous to applicants because the reporting agency has no vested interest in your value as a future employee. What they care about is verifying the accuracy of what you've said during the application process. If they see data older than 10 years, the hiring company won't ever hear about it. This prevents the big company from being sued for illegally disqualifying candidates.
On the other hand, smaller companies where human resources performs the background checks themselves will see the older conviction data, but they're "not allowed" to consider it. In those cases, they just don't hire you and never give a reason why. No law against that. They will sometimes do the same thing for other non-conviction data less than 10 years old. If you're applying for a job as a 27 year-old, they could see that you were arrested for possessing drug paraphernalia (a pot pipe, for example) and even though your case was thrown out due to an illegal search and you were never convicted, the HR person might just choose to pass you over and say they found "another, more qualified candidate."

[–]dashrendarrr 2 points 20 hours ago 
Not quite. It may still be there in some records. It's no longer legal permissible to hold that conviction against you though.

[–]nssdrone 2 points 16 hours ago

Depends on who it is. An employer can hold it against you if they want.

[–]kublan 1 point 12 hours ago 
They'll hold your haircut against you instead, legally. All arrests are visible to the employer because they're released to the public soon after the arrest.

[–]dashrendarrr 1 point 12 hours ago 
Most larger companies have multiple departments, if they run the background check in-house, that screen information against each other to protect the candidate.

Do you mean in a court of law, e.g. if I'm being tried for a murder and I was involved in a bank robbery previously (and convicted for it), can that be brought up in a jury trial?
It can. Usually my attorney would try to block opposing counsel from using that information in front of the jury, maybe by arguing that the bank robbery and a murder are too distantly related, and the bank robbery occurred 20 years ago so it's irrelevant to my character now, etc.
In theory though, opposing counsel can in some certain cases use it. I know there are evidence rules surrounding it but I can't remember them off the top of my head.

[–]onphonecanttype 1 point 20 hours ago

[–]HectorThePlayboy 1 point 14 hours ago 
Lots of people here taking wild guesses to answer your question. The correct answer is yes, it could be, if state or local laws allow it. Many states have passed laws making it illegal to inquire about arrests that did not lead to conviction. These same laws prohibit background check companies from reporting arrests that did not lead to a conviction.

[–]PornCritic3-D 8 points 1 day ago 
I wasn't allowed to rent an apartment simply because of an arrest when I was 17. No conviction but they actually tild me if they saw me on the premises again they would call the police. I was appalled and also 30 years of age without any further issues. So yeah it pops up. If you ever get arrested save money to have it expunged from your record or sealed if a conviction for almost anything else.

[–]kublan 2 points 17 hours ago 
But don't waste the money if the arrest is already copied to private databases gleaned from public records. If you do a background check on yourself using a private service and the arrest shows up, you'll know you'd waste further funds.

[–]nssdrone 2 points 16 hours ago 
You may qualify to get it sealed since you were only 17, but if you were an adult, they wont expunge or seal your records no matter what, here in Washington. And vacating a conviction doesn't remove anything from your record. It just changes "convicted" to "vacated" and every prospective landlord and employer knows what that really means.

[–]gillandgolly 1 point 18 hours ago 
In the unlikely event that you find it interesting, I can say how it is in Norway:
Nothing is ever off your record. However, only the police and the courts can, in any meaningful sense, do a background check on you.
Employers can require a background check on you, but they have to give the request form to you and get your signature. Then, the police decide whether or not the position merits any kind of background check, and, if it does merit a background check, whether any of your criminal history is relevant to the position. So, if you have applied for a job as a... bank teller, then your DUI is of no relevance to the employer, and thus none of their beeswax. However, if you apply for a job at a daycare or school, and you have a conviction for downloading child pornography, then they absolutely do get that information and are obligated to tell you to fuck right off.
So, in effect, the fact that your record is indelibly etched in stone only matters if you want a job in the police, courts, or military. For a job with the police, you must have kept your nose squeaky clean for all of your life. But with the courts and military, it’s a matter for their discretion.

I still don't get it. Why should drugs be illegal? It's your choice to take drugs, just like it's your choice to take anything. If cigarettes and weed are legal, why aren't other drugs like crack cocaine legal? All drugs will kill you if not taken carefully and moderately, but why should that affect to at least take an illegal drug appropriately, for moderate or even slight use? And what's worse is that some are taken to jail for using an illegal drug, which is just absurd. Maybe rehab would be good, but jail? Really?

[–]bontesla 52 points 1 day ago 
And beyond that - drug prohibition causes substantial harm
Regardless of how you feel about addicts, they don't deserve to be exploited, but frequently are. Given the nature of their substance abuse, they're prone to sexual slavery, victims of theft, and being sold tainted products.
They also have a harder time staying clean if they're marginalized and stigmatized. An job paying adequate wages for someone with a history of criminal drug abuse is hard to find. This means that getting one's life back on track is an uphill battle.

[–]STDemons 11 points 1 day ago 
So what is society supposed to do with addicts, specifically ones that aren't interested in dedicating themselves to rehabilitation?

[–]bontesla 42 points 1 day ago 
Leave them alone... which is largely what we do now in between periods of incarceration.

[–]mutatersalad1 2 points 18 hours ago 
Then how do we get rid of the attitude that we should be spending public funds to aid them? If we're gonna leave them alone we need to make sure we're not letting them get their hands on government aid.

Let them be. If they are caught committing other crimes while on drugs, then they will be prosecuted for the crimes, not for possessing any drug.
Take for example a drug den. It's a vacated building that none of the addicts there own. So, go in and arrest them for trespassing, but don't try to stack on some bullshit about their drugs.

[–]THERES_A_MAN_HERE 3 points 19 hours ago 
I have always thought that if we legalized all drugs, we could use the tax revenue from their sales to fund rehabilitation centers and homeless shelters. So addicts that are interested in rehabilitation have the option and those that aren't have a place to sleep.

[–]letsbebuns 2 points 20 hours ago 
Interesting fact, the war on drugs has completely unchanged the addiction rate...the same population of people (roughly 1.4%) are chronically addicted to drugs now as when we started the war on drugs...it's almost as though it's human nature and 1.4% will always be whacked out on something.
Even if you got rid of all drugs entirely, like heroin and crack and meth just didn't exist, that 1.4% would still be huffing glue or inhaling compressed air.
It's time for a science based approached to addiction. Treat it as a medical problem. Treating it as a criminal problem has made the problem way worse, and it's immoral to boot.

[–]ckwop 2 points 21 hours ago* 
Nicotine is more addictive than heroine.
Right now there are plenty of people managing that addiction just fine because they have access to high quality and (relatively) cheap sources of nicotine.
There is no reason why the same sensible approach can't be applied to other drugs. What's worse is that many of these drugs have analogous pharmaceutical counterparts that are already sold as medicines.
If the recreational drugs are high quality, sold in safe quantities, administered through a pharmacy everything about the drug problem would get better.
They'd be less crime, less long term health problems from doing drugs, we wouldn't be demonizing people etc etc. Just ask Portugal.

[–]letsbebuns 2 points 20 hours ago 
I agree, most people don't realize that street heroin is ~94-97% impure.
Meaning your street heroin will be roughly 3 to 6% heroin, and 95% "other"
No wonder people have so many dang problems with it. It tears their body apart to inject baby powder and bleach and whatever else is mixed in with it.
Additionally, it's easy to overdose this way . Let's say you normally get heroin from ShadyDealerA. He's giving you the 3% pure stuff. But he's out today.
So you go to ShadyDealerB. He gives you what he has, the 6% pure stuff. You take exactly the same weight as you did when you had A's stuff yesterday. Congratulations, by taking the "same amount" you just doubled your dose, overdosed, and died. Because there is NO WAY TO TELL how concentrated that powder you are getting is.
If you got it from a pharmacy you'd have an exact dose every time, and many of the health problems associated with drug use would go away.

[–]the_punt_cunterrr 70 points 1 day ago 
There is no satisfying, reasonable answer to that question. Prohibition was never about harm reduction or keeping people safe. The fact of the matter is that a bunch of racists and special interests started getting involved in drug laws sometime ago and here we are now paying for it decades later. That's really all it is.

[–]NotBrendan 16 points 1 day ago 
Well, I wouldn't say "all", but it's the majority. Would you not say there are legitimate public well-being reasons for some regulation?

[–]the_punt_cunterrr 21 points 1 day ago 
Some regulations are necessary, absolutely. But full on prohibition is not the solution for any drug. Maybe some drug warriors legitimately think prohibition is a net benefit to public health, but I'm guessing they're a relatively dull and naïve bunch.
Racism and profits/job security for certain special interests (both public and private) have been intertwined with drug laws since San Francisco first enacted a recreational opium ban in the 1870s as a "fuck you" to Chinese immigrants.

[–]TheMeatball 1 point 21 hours ago 
I think prohibition can work if it's done right. If you're trying to ban harmless drugs that everyone enjoys, you're setting yourself up to fail.
I think the drug war's failure is because it was so focused on drugs that every knew were not dangerous, and they led a shameful campaign of misinformation.
If we had a prohibition-based "war on drugs" for the legitimately dangerous stuff, while allowing easy access to the in-demand safer stuff, combined with education campaigns and safety measures, I think it would work.
If you could buy weed, psychedelics, and MDMA at a safe regulated shop, it would be a lot harder for people to be introduced to the destructive stuff like meth or PCP or whatever. You're drastically reducing the size and power of the black market.
I don't think all substances on earth should just be free to buy off the shelf. That's wishful thinking.

[–]Thorbinator 1 point 20 hours ago 
Are you familiar with Portugal's drug laws? Drug use of the less harmless ones is a public health issue and needs to not be a criminal issue. Otherwise how do they get treatment?

[–]TheMeatball 2 points 20 hours ago* 
I am.
I think decriminalized possession with a focus on recovery and education, with criminalized production/sale/trafficking would be a good model for those drugs. Help the users, lock up the producers.
I think people have this idea that "prohibition" means no-knock raids and long prison sentences for possession, when it really doesn't have to. Take a softer, more rational, more focused approach and I think it would work just fine.

[–]Thorbinator 1 point 19 hours ago 
Prohibition in the public eye does mean a total ban with criminal charges for possession. It wasn't so on a federal level, but many municipalities did go that far.

[–]the_punt_cunterrr 1 point 20 hours ago 
I agree a lot with what you're saying, but unfortunately there's always going to be demand for meth, heroin, crack, etc. It sucks but it's the truth, and as long as there is a demand there will be a supply. I'd rather we legalize all drugs, thus taking the control of the supply away from gangs and cartels.
I'm not saying we should start selling hard drugs at grocery stores and the like, though. They should be sold at highly secured and regulated dispensaries.

[–]abomb999 5 points 23 hours ago 
Good question, regulation yes, prohibition no. Prohibition is worse than any effect of the drug.

[–]intensely_human 1 point 18 hours ago 
IMO what should be regulated is conduct. So taking PCP should be legal, but going on a wild head-cracking spree with a wrench you named Wanda should be illegal.
Some kind of 1:1 correlation between ingesting PCP and murdering people would warrant some consideration of regulating the PCP itself, but correlations smaller than that, even like 0.90, tell me the law should be focusing on the act, not the probable/possible precursor.
Sort of like how it's totally legal to be armed enough to kill someone, yet still illegal to kill someone.

[–]showyourdata 2 points 18 hours ago 
" Prohibition was never about harm reduction or keeping people safe."
Yes, it absolutely was. It turns out that is was wrong, but thatw as the point.
Did you know alcohol prohibition was put in place to stop domestic abuse?
Did you know it worked far better than they thought it would? Domestic abuse dropped in all areas, some areas it dropped to nearly zero.

[–]anonymity_is_cancer 1 point 15 hours ago 
There is no satisfying, reasonable answer to that question
Some drugs shouldn't be legal, they simply do not offer the user enough time to make ONE mistake, a bad judgement. They can hook you instantly (If you are the right personalty), so I think making them more accessible would not help that whatsoever.

[–]the_punt_cunterrr 1 point 15 hours ago 
Very few people are gonna get hooked after one use, and it happens with prohibition anyway. There's no way it would become a major issue with legalization. It's not worth propping up a violent black market, which is what always happens when you ban a substance, in order to "stop" your proposed scenario.

[–]anonymity_is_cancer 1 point 14 hours ago 
The problem is that if it was legalized, how easily would it be available? Dont we just want to get them off the drugs which will scare them back to their dealer anyways? The harder it is to get, even with the hassle of seeing a doctor and telling him you are hooked and need heroin, it will just make a dealer seem easier wont it?

[–]quantumcoffeemug 5 points 1 day ago 
One could make an argument for banning the sale, though not possession, of opiates. There's a high enough chance someone could try it on a lark and end up dependant; perhaps heroin should not be sold in stores. However, banning possession of anything is counterproductive - it only makes otherwise law abiding people into criminals and prevents addicts from seeking help.

[–]greenshrubbery 3 points 21 hours ago 
The whole drug war is rooted in racism even today. I can go buy an opiate called Kratom in tons of stores all across America. You know why? It used to be a rich white person drug in the US.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 19 hours ago 
When you ban the sale of something, you create a black market. The prices skyrocket, and violent risk-takers move in to capitalize on the artificial inflation.
The only way to remove violence from the equation is to sell drugs at low, industrialized prices. As long as there is prohbition, a black market will exist, and thugs and gang members will move into that black market to fill the unchanging demand.
You can't eliminate demand. You can't eliminate supply. You have to economically undercut the black market to drive them out of existence.

The obvious reasons is for the greater good... supposedly deterring a lot of people that might be prone to addiction from ever trying because it's difficult to obtain and risky to keep.

Have you considered doing even the most cursory search? All prohibition does is fatten the black market, it doesn't prevent anything except the people like me who would do one or two drugs just to see what it's like in a safe environment without the worry of having our lives destroyed for no other reason than having a chemical in our mouths. It's fucking retarded.

[–]o5mfiHTNsH748KVq 2 points 20 hours ago 
I have a good idea of what I'm talking about, as a recovering cocaine addict. Most of my life I was clean, up until the other internet came around. The barrier to entry was lacking the ability to get it and being a small white kid with no connections.
I'm not saying it works on the whole. I don't know. I just know it was what kept me off any drugs for the longest time. For people that don't have good self control, never being put in the situation is the best option. If I could go to the store and purchase a gram, I would be dead by now.
The problem with hard drugs is you don't realize you're addicted until it's already set in. :(

[–]kublan 1 point 17 hours ago* 
Prohibition prevents more than that, for drugs that are highly addictive. A friend of mine tried crack, and it was all over but the crying. It's easy to see that if crack was legal, society would have to deal with more addictions.

[–]CoffeeAndKarma 3 points 1 day ago 
But if it were legal, we could actually be informative about what different drugs actually do. Plus, it means that people with addictions can get quality help without fear of being arrested.

[–]intensely_human 2 points 18 hours ago 
Case in point, I recently moved to Colorado. I'm a pot smoker, but over the years I've been having a more and more adverse reaction to pot. Mentally that is, makes me very anxious.
I think I'm a little bit addicted to pot too, so even as I noticed it wasn't good any more, I still would choose to smoke as sort of an escape. Usually I'd buy an eighth because that's the minimum my dealer would part with. Really what I always wanted was like a joint or less but I'd have to buy this whole eighth. Then I'd be sitting there wondering whether I should throw it all away (after smoking that first bowl) because if I have weed near me I smoke it. It interferes with my work.
Anyway I moved to CO and my relationship with pot has become much more healthy. A number of things happened.
The first is that I got a regular supply, which I could buy in small amounts. Not having to wait around for my dealer to maybe, maybe not call me back and then meet me in five to twelve hours totally removed that random wondering component from my supply. Somehow that helped, though it's hard to articulate how. It just seemed more sane, so I can more objectively decide whether to buy pot this day or that. I no longer have to jump on an opportunity to buy. Pot comes to me when I want it, no more no less.
Second thing is I started looking at strains, always knowing what strain I was getting. I asked around for more chill, less anxiety-inducing strains. I found some, and can get those consistently. I know what I'm getting so there isn't any unpredictability in dose. This steadiness of dose, added to steadiness of supply, seems to have given my brain enough perspective to see my relationship more clearly, to analyze it with fewer confounding factors. That actually led me to try 90 days pot-free for the first time in a decade at least.
90 days pot-free was great. I didn't have any anxiety about losing my connections because my connections are now brick and mortar stores that aren't going anywhere. I got a lot done, made friends, etc.
Finally the third thing happened after my 90 days were up and I decided to smoke again. I bought a container (I buy like a gram at a time) and I noticed that on the standardized label it listed not only THC content but also a percentage content for something called "CBD".
I hadn't heard of CBD before. It must be important, I figured, for it to be on the label. Turns out it is one of the cannabinoids found in some strains, just like THC. I started reading and found that CBD has anti-anxiety and anti-schizophrenic effects. There are strains dedicated to producing CBD.
So I bought some CBD pot (AC/DC) and started mixing it into my Blueberry Diesel.
The anxiety, the paranoia, was gone. 100% and completely gone, and now pot smoking is the pleasant, interesting, chill experience I remember it being from when I started.
Not only that, but even when I'm not smoking I've got a tendency toward paranoia, and that too is mostly gone. For the past two months since I discovered CBD I've been relaxed and happy in a way I haven't been for a long time, almost as long as I can remember.
All of these things, the clarity about my relationship, the ability to choose which strains I'm getting, the ability to put it down for months at a time without losing my connections, and the introduction to CBD, are beautiful results of the white market adoption of this drug.
I can only dream of others being able to transom their relationships to cocaine, LSD, heroin, or other drugs in this way. The clarity, the freedom, the precision, the unexpected treasures, the overall relief and satisfaction, are all things that everybody deserves.

[–]ShesNotATreeDashy 1 point 21 hours ago 
I think the better solution would be that doing drugs is legal, but selling, trafficking, producing, and all that is illegal. The guy addicted to heroin shouldn't be punished, but everyone in the chain getting it to him could be.

[–]CoffeeAndKarma 1 point 21 hours ago 
But part of the problem there is that it still promotes a dangerous black market. It gets that guy who's addicted heroin involved with criminals. A highly regulated market for it would be much better. That way you can still help the people who use while being able to (ideally) control who can but it in the first place.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 13 hours ago

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 19 hours ago 
It has not been effective. The addiction rate has remained an unchanged 1.4% from before the war on drugs started, to now.
The only thing that has changed is:
1) Militarized police that see citizens as enemy combatants
2) War on Drugs budget that increases by $1,000,000,000 each year, $46,000,000,000 this year
3) Loss of freedoms, threat of being kidnapped from your own home for a victimless crime
It's been extremely ineffective since drugs are still everywhere. As it turns out, prohibition DOES NOT WORK.
You know what would work? Economics. If drugs were legal and sold via pharmacy, they would be:
1) Pure. No more sickness from injecting cut drugs.
2) Standardized. No more overdosing because your dealer gave you a stronger batch than last week.
3) Cheap. Drug prices are artificially inflated 100x. The price inflation accounts for the massive amounts of risk criminals take to import/cultivate the drugs. If they were industrialized, DRUG DEALERS WOULD BE OUT OF A JOB.

[–]LewsTherinTelamon 7 points 1 day ago 
For the same reason that it's illegal not to wear your seatbelt - because society needs to be able to intervene when its members are behaving in irresponsibly self-destructive ways. Not only that, but crackheads are not known for respecting the rights of others.

This is the best response here to /u/blackhatlinux's comment. Seat belts make for a good analogy. A large part of me strongly believes the government shouldn't be able to tell me what I can put in my body, but this argument has me so torn on the issue.
I guess the only counterargument would be that there can be benefits from drugs use, while there is no benefit to not wearing a seat belt. Although that's heading into highly subjective territory that is not easy to legislate around.

[–]blackhatlinux 2 points 1 day ago

[–]mutatersalad1 1 point 18 hours ago 
You're also a danger to others when you don't wear a seatbelt. You have personal rights and liberties but not when you try to use those to endanger other people.

[–]Strizzz 1 point 18 hours ago 
Sorry, not I'm not sure what you're saying. Are you saying drugs shouldn't be legal because people endanger others when using them?
Also side note- how does not wearing a seatbelt endanger others?

[–]mutatersalad1 2 points 18 hours ago 
I'm not speaking to drugs in this comment at all.
When you don't wear a seatbelt, if you get in a car crash your body can fly around the car and hit and injure the other people. You can also be launched through the windshield and into the other car and injure people that way.

[–]EDDY08 2 points 1 day ago 
I've had this seatbelt argument many times as a kid. The best reason cited was that in an accident your unrestrained body is a danger to others. I suppose that analogy could extend to drugs as well. The question is, if addicts weren't automatically criminals for being addicts would they still be viewed as harmful to others?

[–]PCartist 8 points 1 day ago 
How much experience do you have with drug addicts/addictions? In terms of harm reduction and public safety I wouldn't agree with legalizing all drugs. I would decriminalize the use of hard drugs and have well funded free rehab. I would probably legalize some soft drugs like marijuana, and open others up for research allowing them to become prescription drugs.
People don't like it when the government "protects them from them selves", unfortunately people are fucking idiots and a threat to everyone else and themselves. I have a neighbor who accidentally shot a hunting rifle into the guy across the streets house, and a friend who keeps loaded guns throughout his house where small children could get them. I have a friend who has been in 4 accidents that totaled 4 different cars, all accidents were his fault. I have a friend who was born addicted to heroin, a friend who lost ~$150,000 worth of scholarships because of drugs, an acquaintance who commits robberies to pay for drugs. Etc ad infinitum ... I have a lot of stories.
Society would become more of a shit show than it already is and you cant make policy decisions based off of moral certitude, and wishful thinking.

[–]creator_of_worlds 4 points 20 hours ago

[–]PCartist 0 points 20 hours ago 
It just isn't that simple. I am ok with a small black market compared to a large retail market. If their was solid evidence that full legalization would reduce harm over all I would support it. For now I am in the decrminilization camp.

[–]creator_of_worlds 6 points 19 hours ago 
No man, it literally is this simple. If there is a demand, there will be a supplier. Although no countries have tried full legalization, you don't need an example. Its just makes logical sense that if we were to take the main money-maker away from gangsters, and put it in a well regulated open market, you cripple them. They no longer have the power or the monopoly on drugs because everyone who wants the hard drugs can get them from legit vendors, and thus putting a halt on the violence that the people in the hoods, ghettos, barrios ,and favelas of the world. Why do you think prohibition was so terrible for the US? Because the mafia controlled the trade. And how do gangsters solve issues? Through bullets. Prohibition does much more harm to society then the drugs themselves
i am ok with a small black market
What you call small I call a massive problem being ignored. Just decriminalizing them puts a band-aid over a gaping wound.

[–]kublan 0 points 16 hours ago 
It really isn't that simple. Say there's a drug that is immediately addictive and drives some of its users to mass murder. By your logic it should be sold in a well regulated open market, so gangsters can't profit. And you can't do anything to the user prior to their murder spree. It's thereby easy to see that your logic at least isn't fair minded. There are more than just 2 ways to address the problems that hard drugs cause.

[–]creator_of_worlds 2 points 15 hours ago*

While I think you should get some better friends, anecdotal evidence won't change the idea that people should be responsible for what they put into their own bodies. If they endanger someone else, there will be legal ramifications. Alcohol is far more deadly than at least half of the Schedule I-III narcotics that are outlawed, but we found ways to work with that. DUI laws, public intoxication laws, rehab centers. And the vast majority of adults enjoy a totally normal life while also enjoying alcohol on occasion. Just because a small percentage of the population becomes addicted or drives while drunk doesn't mean everyone has to stop drinking. This "no child left behind" thinking for federal laws is ridiculous.

[–]kublan 1 point 16 hours ago 
Alcohol is a bad example for your point. It's legal because the majority want it to be legal. That doesn't mean it isn't a net drain on society, despite other laws like for DUI. If < 5% of the people do heroin then the rest of the voters would be better off keeping it illegal.

[–]PCartist 1 point 20 hours ago

We are actually doing a terrible job mitigating the consequences of alcohol. 80% of the alcohol sold in the USA is sold to alcoholics, 10% of the US population consumes 74 drinks per week. 1/3 of traffic fatalities are the result of alcohol. People ages 20-64 have a 10% chance of dying from alcohol related illnesses. The economic cost of alcohol abuse is 249 billion dollars annually. We currently don't provide free or adequate treatment for addicts or alcoholics.
anecdotal evidence won't change the idea that people should be responsible for what they put into their own bodies.
It is just an opinion not an inherent truth, it is no more true than saying people shouldn't be responsible for everything they do or do not put in their bodies. "You cant change the idea that people shouldn't be responsible for what they put in there bodies" is an equally true statement.
If we did follow the doctrine that people ought to be able to have absolute control over what they put in their bodies what would that actually mean? No more prescription drugs just go buy whatever you want without consulting a doctor or obtaining a prescription. You are unconscious, doctor can't administer life saving drugs because you aren't able to agree to it. Parents cannot be compelled to provide life saving care to their children nor vaccinate them. All of those things are really stupid consequences of your opinion.
If they endanger someone else, there will be legal ramifications.
So we can deal with the mess it will cause but fuck considering it a problem or trying to prevent it.
While I think you should get some better friends,
These people are childhood friends or family members who I mainly keep in touch with through facebook or from the grape vine. I have my shit together my friends and SO have their shit together, all of us are addiction free college graduates who behave responsibly. Not that is any of your fucking business who I am friends with.

It seems like you are imagining that if drugs were legal/decriminalized, they'd still be expensive, but they wouldn't. They'd be affordable, and people wouldn't commit so many crimes to get them. The black market/prohibition is what artificially drives the price up, and that artificially inflated price is what causes people to need to steal to feed their addiction.

[–]PCartist 1 point 19 hours ago 
Nope, it is more a matter of availabilty and social acceptance increasing use.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 13 hours ago 
What do you mean, "Nope"?
You're saying the black market does NOT drive the price up? Because that's a pretty ill informed thing to say.
We're not talking about social acceptance, we're talking about people not committing crimes, and I'm saying if drugs are cheaper, there will be less crime.

[–]PCartist 1 point 13 hours ago 
No I mean having readily available affordable drugs will cause more people to become addicted because it will be legal and somewhat socially acceptable. Drug related crime having to do with trafficking and sale would go down for sure.

[–]letsbebuns 0 points 13 hours ago 
This is straight up false and shows you have not researched this issue very much.
The addiction rate has been an unchanging 1.4% for the last 50 years, longer than the war on drugs. The ENTIRE war on drugs has had ZERO effect on the addiction rate.
Additionally, addiction is a medical issue, not a criminal one. If you care about addiction so much, then we need to get cops totally disassociated with addiction.
Lastly, when drugs are no longer impure and cut with dangerous filler chemicals, the health and addiction issues that users experience will be far less severe. Most of the reason addiction is so terrible right now is that users are forced to inject tons of street cutting powders just to get the 3% heroin.
Average street heroin purity is roughly 3%...the other 97%...dangerous stuff that causes massive harm
So if you really care about health and addiction as you claim, prohibition is making the problem worse on multiple fronts. Even in the best case scenario, it's had zero benefit to society. It's basically a circlejerk so middle america can feel like they are doing something moral - but what they are actually doing is constructing a society that hates freedom, hates liberty, and celebrates when "undesirables" have their freedom and liberty taken away.
Which in my mind, is a very anti-american concept.

[–]legalize-drugs 1 point 18 hours ago 
All psychedelics should be legalized as soon as possible, because they ave a ton of benefit, and people should be allowed to have these experiences and should know that what they're getting is safe.
Secondly, certain drugs do indeed cause a lot of harm, but drug prohibition hasn't helped the problem AT ALL. It hasn't lowered use or abuse rates. All it's done it cause a ton of peripheral violence. People can get harmful drugs such as meth and heroin easily in prison. Portugal decriminalized all drugs, and they've seen use rates drop, as well as violent crime. You probably know that. I think decriminalization would be a huge step forward, but ultimately we should legalize them all, so people know what they're getting and the violence associated with the black market is drastically reduced.

[–]PM_ME_UR_OBSIDIAN 1 point 22 hours ago 
I think we need to rethink drug law and addict care. Criminalization is a stupid idea, but so is blanket legalization.
Do you have any good reads on the topic of public policy when it comes to addiction?

[–]PCartist 2 points 20 hours ago 
Portugal and the Netherlands are on the right track their policies are a google search away. I am by no means an expert just have some opinions that are semi-informed and don't rely on some higher moral truth, which seems to be the case with people who are either staunchly for or against drugs legalization.

[–]OneOfDozens 6 points 1 day ago 
Certain groups used certain drugs more. It's a way to punish them, it's a way to keep people from voting, it's a way to keep prisons full so there's a continuous supply of extremely cheap labor (slavery is still legal for prisoners). Follow the money always. It's not just private prisons, but public prisons allowing corporations to use their prisoners as laborers, it's police/guard unions fighting for harsh penalties to keep themselves employed.
Then you get to the drugs making people think about things differently and maybe reject the societal structures and desire to buy buy buy instead of worrying about fellow people. Can't have that

[–]Deathoftheages 4 points 1 day ago 
I think a big part is that certain drugs (Crack, heroin, meth, and the like) have more effect on families and society as a whole. Whether it's from broken homes, crime, or people going in and out of rehab. Yeah you can get a lot of this with alcohol too but it's way to ingrained unfortunately.

[–]letsbebuns 5 points 19 hours ago 
If people weren't constantly being arrested, and if the drugs weren't so impure, the problems that affect families with these drugs would be so much less.

[–]sporkbox 1 point 9 hours ago 
Honestly, the government doesn't give two fucks about families, except to be able to exploit the broken ones. DHS and CPS are some of the most sexist and dysfunctional departments of the government and we'd be better off without them. Government has no business dictating how families should be.

[–]legendaRyan 3 points 1 day ago 
There is a case to be made for drugs that cause people to act out violently. If you could insure drug takers would stay in their residence or some private place, I'd be all for any drug- so long as it's not affecting anyone else.

[–]TuPacMan 7 points 1 day ago 
I've always heard that the reason alcohol is legal is because it has been around forever.
It's also extremely difficult to place a prohibition upon a substance of which the majority of a population already uses fairly consistently.

[–]letsbebuns 2 points 20 hours ago 
You know the USA prohibited alcohol for a while and it was a disaster right?
Well the war on drugs is an even bigger disaster. It has created so many gangs.
The war on drugs sends the message: "Because drug prices are artificially inflated, you don't need a job or school, you can get really rich selling drugs."
If drugs were legal, then gang members would have to get a job at burger king or starve.

[–]kublan 1 point 17 hours ago 
By the same logic, we should legalize murder because assassins can get rich. The war on drugs is a failure but legalizing all drugs isn't necessarily the best alternative. Hard drugs cost taxpayers, so drug users should have to compensate for that. The best option probably includes rehab in the sentence.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 13 hours ago 
Hard drugs in a prohibition system cost taxpayers exponentially more than hard drugs in a legalized system would. Currently hard drugs are extremely impure, and difficult to measure in quantity due to never knowing what purity the drugs might be. This accounts for a majority of the sickness and overdose experienced. Additionally, theft to get drug money would drop if drugs were allowed to exist at market price, which is an order of magnitude lower than current black market prices.
People get sick mostly because drugs are impure.
People overdose mostly because there is no way to accurately measure the strength of street drugs.
People steal mostly because the price of drugs is artificially inflated by prohibition.
EVERYTHING you claim you hate about drugs would be lessened by ending prohibition.

[–]kublan 0 points 13 hours ago 
You're ignoring alternate solutions, which do exist. There aren't only 2 solutions, prohibition / prison or full legalization. Give a $500 reward leading to the conviction of a hard drug user. For each of the millions of users outed, give them 2 choices: voluntarily submit to a drug test, or have 10% higher taxes for life. If tested positive, convict them and give them 2 choices: a 5% higher tax for life, or rehab and monitoring for a year. Tons of other possibilities too. Smoking rates drop as smoking becomes more expensive. The same should be true for all hard drugs when combined with rehab.
The reason prohibition doesn't work is largely because it's designed to profit certain groups at society's expense. E.g. private prisons.

I was more thinking like bath salts. But yea, alcohol can be pretty bad.

[–]snizarsnarfsnarf 4 points 1 day ago 
No offense but this statement is pretty ignorant. So first off, bath salts is a slang term that refers to almost ANY research chemical that has not been made explicitly illegal yet. These can have wildly varying effects (like the differences between stimulants like amphetamines or hallucinogens like lsd or dissociatives like keta mine or pcp). Grouping them all together and making blanket staementa about thwlem makes no sense. There is also no reason to believe these make you any more violent than any other drugs. The famous media case of the man eating another man's face while on bath salts was fabricated. The only thing in his system was marijuanna metabolyes. (On mobile so I can't link but feel free to search yourself). Let alone, violence is already a crime. Vast majorities of drug users are non violent, and if they become violent there are systems in place to take care of them and punish them.

Yet alcohol is legal?

[–]anothertawa -1 points 1 day ago 
The argument for alcohol is that you don't necessarily drink it to get drunk. There is no reason to do drugs other than getting high.

[–]EssentiallyEve 2 points 22 hours ago 
Thats actually a terrible argument and really holds no ground. You could also argue that people don't necessarily drink coffee for a caffeine fix, but that would really hold no grounds either.

[–]anothertawa -1 points 22 hours ago 
Why would it hold no grounds? Have you never heard of decaffeinated coffee? Yes there are still small amounts of caffeine, but people aren't necessarily drinking it for a caffeine fix. i.e. it's sole purpose is not to get you "high" on caffeine, whereas the sole purpose of for example, pot, would be to get you high (no, I'm not talking about pot for medical reasons).

[–]EssentiallyEve 3 points 21 hours ago 
why are you talking about decaffeinated coffee? Were we talking about non alcoholic drinks earlier? your argument is flimsy at best. "the sole purpose" of consuming alcohol is what again?

[–]anothertawa -2 points 21 hours ago 
I'm saying that the sole purpose of drinking coffee isn't for the caffeine, based on the fact that plenty of people drink decaf. I'm not sure what your argument is otherwise. For some people, caffeine just happens to be in coffee and they don't drink it for the energy. Same with alcohol, for some people alcohol just happens to be in a good wine, they aren't drinking it for the alcohol. It enhances the taste. Pot, on the other hand, is taken exclusively to get high.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 20 hours ago 
That's a pretty bad argument. Alcohol is not a necessary nutrient and the only reason people consume it is for its disassociative properties.

[–]CoffeeAndKarma 0 points 1 day ago 
Uh, that's bullshit. 99% of the time, if you're drinking, you're planning to get drunk. Besides, that's not even what I was arguing here. I was saying that if you use the classification of "drugs that make people violent" to decide what should be banned, alcohol would be banned.
Also, I guarantee that if alcohol couldn't get you drunk, it wouldn't be a popular drink.

[–]anothertawa 3 points 1 day ago 
99% of the time? Have you never heard of a glass of wine with dinner? Or something enjoying a sip of scotch? Or irish coffee? Heck, alcohol is even used to cook. I'm giving you arguments as to why alcohol is different than your typical drugs.

[–]CoffeeAndKarma 2 points 23 hours ago 
Right, cooking. And dinner parties/wine tastings are the minority, at least in my experience. But maybe mine is atypical.
I still maintain my point that if alcohol couldn't get you drunk that we never would have bothered to cultivate it, though.
And it's not like alcohol is the only drug with other uses. Marijuana can be used for hemp without even producing a significant drug, but hemp still isn't legal. And it's far more versatile than alcohol.

[–]anothertawa 1 point 23 hours ago

[–]HelpingOutPops 1 point 21 hours ago 
If the drugs "cause" people to act violently, then why aren't violent criminals who were on drugs allowed to use the fact they were high as a defense for the other crimes? The reason: because drugs don't "cause" you to do anything, you make that choice on your own, and that's why you're responsible for what happens.
It's stupid.

[–]legendaRyan 1 point 12 hours ago 
I was thinking of violence in terms of attacks, thefts, etc. in order to satisfy the addiction. Not that they are necessarily high at the time.
There is also a case to be made for how they would become commercialized if drugs were all legal. Companies would surely start producing more pure, effective drugs. That could have far reaching effects on individuals and the public. I believe there was a study using monkeys that released hormones into its system at the push of a button. The monkeys resorted to pushing the button over and over, even foregoing food and water.
For a society to function, there is probably a point where drug use should be controlled.
With all this said, I am for fewer drug laws / weaker punishments that the US has now.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 20 hours ago 
Punish the harm when it happens. It is immoral to punish someone for drinking because a drunk once committed murder. You can only punish someone when the harm actually occurs. This whole "pre-crime" thing is ridiculous, especially since people's reactions under drugs are extremely poorly understood by lawmakers.

[–]legendaRyan 1 point 12 hours ago 
I was more alluding to the drug addiction that comes with the drug use. It's the behavior of addicts that is more predictable by everyone, including lawmakers.
Also, while I agree with you that "pre-crime" is unfair, it is not a mystery as to why there are more drunk drivers on the road after 2am. A quick search found a Forbes article that said 54% of car crashes at night involved alcohol.
So while it is unfair to blame people who drink, society should not simply sit back and wait for the innocent drivers to be injured or killed by drunk drivers. Society should take steps to encourage drinkers to not drive.

[–]kublan 1 point 17 hours ago 
Hard drug users are a net drain on society in many other ways, even if they stay in their private place while high. They are more likely to steal, for example, even if the drugs are cheap, if they can't hold a job.

[–]legendaRyan 1 point 12 hours ago 
Totally agree. While I tend to be more for people getting to do what they want, there are a lot of negatives that are associated with the heavy drugs you mention.
I think it's these "drains" on society that others forget will come with wide spread legalization.

[–]32F492R0C273K 1 point 22 hours ago 
Is it because if you become a drug dependant degenerate that is so hooked you can't support yourself and become a burden on society? I feel like for some drugs it's less about it killing the user and more about what to do with them before they're dead. If they're just in and out of treatment they can't afford then who fronts the bill?
Just want to clarify I'm pretty pro legal drugs, I'm just debating :)

[–]legendaRyan 1 point 12 hours ago 
For me, it's that hard drug users can becomes slaves to the addiction. Slaves to the point that they will do anything to get more drugs. This can obviously lead to many negatives for the individual - and the surrounding community.

[–]Anberlin_XI 9 points 22 hours ago 
I wouldn't have a problem if meth and heroin were illegal or any really hard drug, but I believe the punishment for these types of drugs shouldn't be jail time. I think some sort of rehab facility would be more appropriate. Unfortunately this is probably never going to happen

[–]bontesla 12 points 21 hours ago 
I can appreciate where you're going.
The problem with punishing with rehab is that it's never good to force rehab. If the addict isn't ready to travel that road, they won't. And when they are? You've associated it with punishment.

[–]Anberlin_XI 3 points 21 hours ago

I've got a question for you, (or really anyone willing to answer) as I'm curious:
If no drug is illegal, what do you think would happen with prescription medication? What would you suggest we do with those? If none of them are controlled, wouldn't we have an issue with people getting scripts for a drug they don't need and simply selling them? As of right now, the only thing that really slows this is that the buyers and the sellers can get in trouble for doing it. I feel like the "no drug should be illegal" mentality would hurt someone in the long run with prescriptions.

Just like cocaine the main ingreedient indeed comes form a plant, however just like aspirin's main ingredient salicylic acid you must process the coca before you have cocaine.
Marijuana? Nope, you chop it down and dry it out. Good try though bud, your head was almost in the right place!

[–]abornagainneet 2 points 21 hours ago 
THC is a drug. By the act of processing it, you don't magically turn it into a drug, same applies to cocaine and to aspirin. They're drugs from the start, we just make them fit for use in certain ways. THC happens to be easily used by smoking a plant it is found in.

[–]AllDepressedChips -1 points 21 hours ago 
There is no act of processing THC there bud. Go learn something huh?

[–]mikitronz 2 points 21 hours ago 
The "it" he was referring to isn't marijuana but sources of drugs. He is saying that things don't become drugs by being processed. A drug is defined as a substance that has biological effects on humans or other animals. The definition of a drug is not related to being processed or not. That is why THC, like aspirin and opioids like cocaine and morphine, is a drug.

Nobody is saying a guy who wants to smoke pot has the same moral high ground as a black person who was oppressed during segreation, but I think the argument is this:
In both cases, the individual wants to do something that is not immoral, and in both cases, because the law is wrong, their freedom is taken away from them.
To me, the analogy is apt. Just because a law exists, doesn't mean it is moral. And if it's immoral, it should not be followed, according to the founding fathers.

As current Spokane resident, I don't understand the hate we get from people on the west side.
Seattle is absolutely amazing for visitors... Glitzy high rises, shopping for days, Pike Place, the aquarium, the flight museum, etc. There are bars, restaurants, and venues to suit anyone's fancy. The Seahawk, Mariners, and huskies are right there if you need a sports fix.
The thing is, all you have to do is walk a few blocks south of downtown to find an area just as sketchy as East Sprague or Hillyard in Spokane. In Spokane, all you have to do is drive to Liberty Lake or the backside of the South Hill to find stunning houses that'd fit in in Bellevue. Every city has nice and shitty areas, and Spokane isn't any different. It's likely that the ratio of nice to not nice is smaller, but it's not like we live in a meth-infested trailerpark wasteland.
Spokane is missing a lot of the things that make Seattle a great place to visit. We have sweet venues, cool hotels, landmarks, parks, bars, and museums, and restaurants. We just have a lot less of them or they're mundane in comparison.
Spokane's like a Seattle suburb - a place you live, not visit. The downtown is perfectly fine if you live in the region and aren't looking for tourists attractions. It's getting better, but it's still just a regional hub.

Having grown up in Spokane and moved away....Spokane is actually pretty darn nice overall, great place to live. Especially now, the city is improving dramatically recently. It's no longer meth city USA

[–]revcon 24 points 23 hours ago 
The downtown is improving so much! There's still a lot of rundown areas but overall it is so much nicer than 5 or 6 years ago. I live downtown in a beautiful turn of the century building for insanely cheap. I'm a few blocks away from coffee shops, parks, great restaurants, a mall with a ton of brand new stores, museums, movie theaters, concert venues, and a huge waterfall. I walk to my office every day and never feel unsafe.
I think Spokane is really up-and-coming, and it's sooooo cheap to live here. There's definitely a lot left to clean up, but it's really fun to live here while there's a growing art community and lots of cool people actively trying to improve the city. There's a lot of really charming older buildings and some great neighborhoods.
It gets a bad rap (not undeserved IMO) but I'd say it's improved tremendously and has a lot of potential.

[–]Blackagar-Boltagon 171 points 1 day ago 
I was born and raised here, I really don't get the hate Spokane gets. It's no different than most other larger-small cities.
It's family friendly, plenty of outdoor activities. Good food, good beer, most concert tours roll through. We have a river which is cool. For having a bigger city feel it's amazing how small town it can feel, nearly everyone you run into is a mutual friend, or something.
I think most of it is group mentality and when X people say it sucks, Y people just join in.

[–]TanksfortheMammaries 135 points 1 day ago 
Ex resident of OR here, and other places, and recent transplant to Spokane.
We have a moderately affordable place in the country, literally 15 minutes from downtown, have rock climbing and great mountain biking, not far from Lake Coeur d'alene, at the foothills of the Rocky Mtns, Spokane and Little Spokane Rivers, Riverside Park, not far from BC, world class hunting nearby, moose walk through our front yard, etc...
My kids walk to school that's 5 minutes away, no problems with theft, meth heads, break ins of any kind.
Does Spokane have drugs? Yes, most larger cities do, this is not news.
By all means, yes, Spokane is just horrible, please stay away. Do not come here.

[–]Blackagar-Boltagon 20 points 1 day ago 
This is exactly how I worded my comment in my head. I just could transfer it properly. Thank you!

[–]sherlocknessmonster 15 points 21 hours ago 
What part of Spokane do you live in where there aren't any, theft, meth heads, and break ins...even the South Hill (Spokane's "wealthiest" neighborhoods) has all of these things...as a matter of fact Spokane is one of the most dangerous small cities Link.

[–]Drchrisco 10 points 21 hours ago 
Spokane isn't listed in the source of your link, nor is listed on the top 10 dangerous mid-sized cities (94k-241k)

[–]sherlocknessmonster 2 points 21 hours ago* 
Spokane was on that list I believe last year or the year before..the source link must have updated to newer stats.
Edit: my phone likes to do weird autocorrect to actual words I type

[–]Drchrisco 4 points 20 hours ago 
Spokane does have a high property crime rate, but its violent crime is relatively low (645/100k, about 1/3 the rate of oakland (the current #2). I would assume if the list had them listed at 2, they were either incorrectly using property crimes instead of/included with violent crime (which would explain why the list has changed).

[–]sherlocknessmonster 1 point 20 hours ago 
I believe it was based on reported crime and not just violent crime...but it was picked up on all the major news outlets last year in Spokane

[–]Drchrisco 4 points 20 hours ago 
Well that is a ridiculous stat to use when determining how dangerous a city is.

[–]shaund91 9 points 21 hours ago 
Like with most cities, it's residents will defend it despite obvious issues. After moving away I'll never be going back except to visit family. I'll probably never live east of the cascades actually if I can help it. It's amazing how it's like two different states on each side of the mountains.

[–]mutatersalad1 6 points 18 hours ago 
The state is infinitely better on the east side, holy fuck. Seattle blows as a place to live, and outside that you just have a handful of "meh" places (Kamiakin, Yelm, Marysville, Pilchuck, Bremerton, Tumwater, Leavenworth etc) that have NOTHING interesting or of note to experience.
The east side has a crazy variety in population, lifestyle choices, interesting shit to see and do outside of just one city (the Gorge, anybody?) And easy access to pretty much everywhere in and around Washington for vacation/travel purposes.

[–]slickrick2222 1 point 14 hours ago 
What are you talking about? Leavenworth is on the east side. And Kamiakin? I don't that that is even a town in Washington, its a high school.
I lived on the east side for over 20 years and I don't think anyone would say that there is more of a variety of population, lifestyle choices, interesting shit etc. on the east side. I'm not going to bash it cause it definitely has his good points, but you are way off. Have you been to the east side of the state?

[–]BattleBull 2 points 19 hours ago 
Your missing out on one of the best parts of the State, right in the middle in the mountains! Maybe I just really like North Bend.

[–]jenninsea 4 points 19 hours ago 
At this point North Bend is just part of the extended Eastside. It's even part of King County.

[–]Zootification 4 points 19 hours ago 
I like North Bend, but it's still west of the cascades.
I have to agree with that guy. Washington sucks east of the cascades. It's all farms, dry plains and small towns. It's fun to visit(Blue lake is a yearly camping trip for me, and I like to go out to the Wild Horses Monument during meteor showers), but to live there? No thanks.
North bend is great though. Love hiking in that area.

[–]avboden[S] 18 points 1 day ago 
Exactly, and another huge benefit is if you want a little land, living out in the west-county is easy and driving into town is 20minutes or less from the immediate vicinity. You have your choice of all types of living in the area.

[–]BelongingsintheYard 8 points 22 hours ago 
I really like it west of Spokane. The high desert and ponderosa pine forests are great. If you head north you get for, larch, pine, cedar. And tons of aspen. I'm a tree guy apparently.

[–]Needbouttreefiddy 1 point 20 hours ago 
I'm up north of Colbert. It's great for the mountain views and trees.

[–]lolredditor 1 point 20 hours ago 
So the positive of Spokane is that you don't actually have to live in it? Gotcha.

[–]DukPep 5 points 1 day ago 
Every city has that mob mentality. Hang around a bunch of cynical younger folks in New York City then you're likely to think NYC is too main stream. On the same token if you're hanging out with a bunch of new to NYC people you're liking to have the glimmer of hope in your eye.
TL;DR you and your opinions/views are the equivalent to the people you put yourself around.

[–]Graminoids 1 point 7 hours ago 
I dunno man, I moved here a few years ago and ever since coming here i've pretty much hated everything around Spokane. Only reason i'm still here is because it's cheaper to live with parents + Community college for the first 2 years of college.
Spokane is literally the taint of Washington. It's right on the cusp of the fun parts but doesn't just reach it. It's perpetually in a state of kinda-shitty/boring.

[–]lolredditor 3 points 20 hours ago 
I think that the biggest downside to Spokane is that you could very easily be in Spokane Valley, Post Falls, or Coeur d'Alene instead and be paying less for a better spot to live...you just have to drive a little further to get to downtown. I think that was why Spokane was such a ghetto for the longest time, it was just too easy to move to a more rural spot, so anyone who wanted a more relaxed environment with less crime could have it.
Anyway, Spokane is better than it was, but it's still a hole compared to what you could have if you accept a 15 minute commute.

[–]Needbouttreefiddy 1 point 19 hours ago 
When people talk about Spokane, I assume they mean the Spokane metro Area. Spokane, Colbert, Five Mile, Mead, Coeur d Alene, the Valley, Post Falls, Reardon, etc....

[–]lolredditor 2 points 19 hours ago 
Nah, the complaints are mainly about the main part of Spokane.
What complaints could they possibly have with CdA or Post Falls? When people complain about Seattle they typically aren't also complaining about Kent or Issaquah. Some of the spokane metro area is included(just like redmond or bellevue might be included with seattle), but not parts that are in another state 20+ minutes away from city limits.

[–]Fattswindstorm 2 points 19 hours ago 
I'm sorry but i shit on you guys so often. It's like ragging on Butte, everyone gets it. except you guys are a bigger city. The closer, shittier, Seattle. No offense to you but you are going to get most of the Western Montana's big city flack, along with Billings, and Great Falls. everyone else is outside are geographic neighbor hood.

[–]Sub116610 4 points 1 day ago

[–]kernunnos77 1 point 1 day ago 
That sounds a lot like how I described Indianapolis when I lived there - a bigger city than I'm used to, but not scary or unfriendly, and with plenty of cool stuff to do. Also, the river is pretty cool.

[–]slickrick2222 1 point 14 hours ago 
Yeah, I agree alot of Spokane is a beautiful city. No, not out north, but downtown, Browne's Addition and the South Hill have tons of nice old historic buildings and homes. The surrounding area is beautiful and affordable, very much like Bend, OR which people get all hot and bothered about. The river through downtown is an awesome feature most cities would love to have. I never felt like the crime was out of control compared to many cities on the west side.

[–]NPPraxis 28 points 22 hours ago 
Spokane has changed dramatically in the last five years. Complete resurgence. There's actually a food scene, tons more diversity, and things to do. New restaurants/stores/entertainment popping up every week.
When I was younger, I was sure I'd eventually leave Spokane as an adult. Now, it's actually pretty nice and I don't plan to leave. The property values are so cheap I'll have my house paid off pretty quick, and can travel whenever I feel like easily.

[–]MoarCowb3ll 8 points 19 hours ago 
I just moved from Spokane last year after being there for 3 years in the military. I would take Spokane any day over living in San Diego where I grew up. I still consider moving back after I get out, such a beautiful place.

[–]BelongingsintheYard 6 points 22 hours ago 
No. That's deer park. You just have to go north from Spokane. Spokane gets a bad rap but I like it.

[–]sherlocknessmonster 6 points 21 hours ago 
Two mentions of Deer Park in the comments on the front page of reddit...I don't think I would see the day

[–]BelongingsintheYard 5 points 21 hours ago 
Neither did I. Haha. May as well throw in Loon Lake Chewelah and Colville Sandpoint can come too.

Pretty sure you're thinking of Metaline/Metaline Falls.

You're right. Got that screwed up.

[–]country_hacker 1 point 19 hours ago 
Or hit the other side of the mountains and hit Cusick/Ione/Metaline. Lived there ten years, now I'm just outside Deer Park and it's weird being in the /r/news limelite. :-)

[–]Silverbug 1 point 19 hours ago 
Sandpoint is in Idaho. We'll stay out of your mess, Washington.

[–]BelongingsintheYard 2 points 19 hours ago 
I just wanted to invite your nice little town to a better state but fine.

[–]Silverbug 1 point 19 hours ago 
I'm not from Sandpoint, grew up in Newman Lake and now live in Boise. Washington has its positives, but so does the panhandle. If you need convincing, come join us in Southern Idaho for a couple weeks, enjoy all that bad city planning and small time politicians can offer!

[–]BelongingsintheYard 1 point 19 hours ago 
Haha. No thanks. Hells canyon is as close as I get to southern Idaho. I like the CDA area. Lived there for six years. But post falls is a shithole and most of the inhabitants belong there.

[–]mutatersalad1 1 point 18 hours ago 
Sandpoint
I want it noted that when they came over to my high school to play football they vandalized our locker room. Just like Cheney did (FUCK YOU CHENEY HIGH SCHOOL YOU CUNTS) because they're terrible sports with a terrible culture in their town.
Don't lump those nice guys from Colville in with them, that's mean. I actually liked those guys all four years.

[–]BelongingsintheYard 1 point 18 hours ago 
Everybody is a cunt in high school.

[–]mutatersalad1 1 point 18 hours ago 
Not everyone damages other school's locker rooms and tries to humiliate their team with insults after sports matches, however.

[–]BelongingsintheYard 1 point 17 hours ago 
I went to post falls high. There is a reason I avoided the kids that only were there for sports.

[–]isamura 4 points 20 hours ago 
Part of the reason could be because The Penny Arcade guys are from Spokane and they would jokingly call refer to it as the ass fissure of the state. In defense of Spokane, they grew up in Hillyard which is the shittiest neighborhood in Spokane, so I understand their perspective.

[–]Needbouttreefiddy 6 points 19 hours ago 
No they didn't. I went to high school with both of them, they both went to Mead. Hillyard is Rogers territory.

Never would think to see a mention of Deer Park in a comment section on reddit...there is so much people don't know about that town

[–]Energy_Turtle 9 points 1 day ago 
Deer Park is awesome. Low land costs, close to Spokane, and they have a Zips and Double Eagle Pawn. I'd live there if it wasn't so far from my work.

[–]avboden[S] 15 points 1 day ago

[–]Energy_Turtle 5 points 1 day ago 
Creampie shakes are the shit. And hilarious to offer to my girlfriend.

[–]avboden[S] 5 points 23 hours ago 
I love the zips in Cheney, for some reason it's extra magical....given could be that it's the only place open late night there so when i'm working at a summer camp at EWU it's the place to go to at 3am and everything tastes better at 3am, but still.

[–]pat_man 6 points 22 hours ago 
As an EWU student... Theres something special about our Zips. You should try it at 2am on a weekend when its filled with drunk college students

[–]cdjaco 2 points 19 hours ago

It kinda makes me laugh that one of the selling points of that place is a pawn shop...

[–]Energy_Turtle 1 point 19 hours ago 
It's an awesome pawn shop. Sooooo many guns and they will find whatever gun you want.

[–]diosmuerteborracho 1 point 18 hours ago 
I don't doubt it. It's just that a pawnshop being the big attraction doesn't do anything to quash the drugged out reputation of that region.

[–]country_hacker 2 points 19 hours ago 
Just moved back despite having an hour commute, live just south of town. Deer Park is great, well worth having to drive to work.

[–]Silverbug 1 point 23 hours ago 
When I was growing up in the area, 20 some-odd years ago, it was pretty bad. We use to work on the firefighting PBYs at the airport.

Dude, no way! I used to hang out with the Pilots on their downtime while they were waiting for calls, super cool dudes. Really miss hearing that old lady flying over, seeming to skim the treetops.

[–]mutatersalad1 1 point 18 hours ago 
You can get Zipstm without having to subject yourself to the hell of going through Deer Park.
The only good reason I found to go to Deer Park is to steamroll their football team every year.

[–]badseedjr 21 points 1 day ago 
Yeah, it sucks if you hate nature, and beer, and lakes, and parks, and food. I'm seriously 10 minutes away form a rad mountain bike course. 45 minutes from snowboarding. 30ish minutes from a lake in several directions. 10 minutes from several breweries. Walking distance to pubs and restaurants with great food and beer. There are multiple running clubs, a climbing gym that used to be the tallest indoor gym in the world, a huge park in the center of town with plans to upgrade it. But yeah, you're right. It sucks. Don't come here.

[–]LeighCedar 11 points 23 hours ago

Or, you know, some people just aren't into beer and don't use it as a crutch to make things enjoyable. Without beer 95% of shit in Spokane is boring as fuck. Riverfront park is fun to go to once, after that it has practically nothing to offer.
Only alright part of spokane is events that sometimes happen, but even then they are usually kind of shit.

[–]badseedjr 1 point an hour ago 
You sound angry. Without beer, there's still a ton of shit to do. Saying it's not fun without beer just proves you haven't tried to find anything. There is a shit load of hiking and biking. Climbing gym, outdoor climbing, several running clubs, several upscale restaurants, even Hastings holds Magic: the gathering tournaments if that's what you're in to. If you don't like beer, maybe you like wine and could go to one of the several local wineries here, or check out one of the giant amount of concerts that play nightly, local or otherwise. Seriously, if you think there's nothing, you're just being ignorant. Thanks for implying I'm using beer and alcohol as a crutch though, asshole. Because I enjoy beer doens't mean I need it, you pretentious dick.

[–]the_sword_of_brunch -4 points 1 day ago* 
As someone currently living in Cda and working in Spokane Valley can confirm, Spokane sucks.
Edit: First downvoted comment, cool! To clarify I love the inland northwest, when I say Spokane sucks I'm comparing it to the rest of the area. Still only my opinion but I would still choose Spokane over moving out of area.

[–]badseedjr 7 points 1 day ago 
Don't you judge Spokane based on the Valley. That's a different city and it does suck.

[–]manfly 2 points 22 hours ago 
Spokane Valley can confirm
Yeah there's your problem. Go to Perry district on south hill or anywhere downtown, it's all in a huge upswing right now. The valley, most of it, blows

[–]the_sword_of_brunch 1 point 21 hours ago 
There are nice places certainly, but there's also Brownes Addition. As a whole Spokane is better than it was 10 years ago and maybe I'm soft living in Cda but I think this link helps explain my perspective.
http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/wa/spokane/crime/

[–]revcon 1 point 21 hours ago 
Yeah it's all property crime. You can expect to have your car broken into once or twice but it's not dangerous. Also, Browne's Addition is really cute. The little roundabout with adorable restaurants and all the Victorian homes are just darling. The MAC is really nice and there's great walking trails with pretty views. There's definitely some characters in CDA Park after dark but otherwise it's a perfectly nice area.

[–]Needbouttreefiddy 1 point 20 hours ago 
The Valley is one long abandoned strip mall

[–]manfly 1 point 20 hours ago 
That's pretty much how I look at it too. My folks lived on the 'outskirts' off of Sullivan and 24th area, so going that way south and the opposite way north, there are some lovely parts, but I agree..the heart of the valley is a disgusting stripmall with lots of wiggers

[–]blockhead123 1 point 20 hours ago 
As someone who grew up in CDA and now lives in the Valley, I don't really get the hate.

[–]rKremlin -3 points 1 day ago 
The whole area sucks if you didn't grow up there. People aren't really friendly. They appear friendly but don't make friends with outsiders very readily. For a male anyway. As a female I'm sure it's great.

Whatever but you won't find me blaming hundreds of thousands of people because I can't make a friend or fit in.

[–]rKremlin 1 point 17 hours ago 
That's not quite what I said. The answer is make friends with people who aren't from there. That might not have occurred to you since you probably are from there and you think everyone is like you. But even if it was the case it wouldn't matter because I heard the same thing from just about everyone when I was there.

[–]badseedjr 1 point 1 day ago 
Not sure where you're at, but everyone I know is super friendly and we invite new people in town to come do activities with us quite a bit. Do you run at all? There are 3-4 running clubs that always want new people. Great way to meet locals who are friendly.

[–]rKremlin -1 points 23 hours ago 
Running is hard on the body. Other than that it's not bad. Not really my thing. I'd be more into lifting, which is a much different scene.

WSU alum from SoCal here. When I was a freshman, I was taught to call it any of the following: Spokompton, Sookanistan, Spokanada. But it is actually a fine place. I have friends who live there and love it. It has its problems but it's definitely a nice place.

[–]vinnythehammer 1 point 15 hours ago 
Just visited Spokane recently, definitely a town I could see myself living in. Gives off a small-town vibe with the somewhat busier college atmosphere.

I'm sorry to rain on your parade, but Fresno has always been the undisputed champ.

[–]BJJJourney -3 points 1 day ago 
Having family there and visiting every so often, there is a reason it has the nickname Spokompton.

[–]engeleh 1 point 22 hours ago 
We used to call it that, but it was a different place back then and we hated the small towns we grew up in as well, so it doesn't mean much. I expect Spokane will likely grow a good bit in the next decade, which is a shame because right now it's a great mid-size college town with food, music, and all of the rest of the things we like cities for but without the traffic.

[–]ImA90sChick 0 points 20 hours ago 
Spokane is actually pretty darn nice overall, great place to live.
Sure... if you're into underground meth labs and rampant alcoholism (I know you say it's no longer meth city, and obviously it's way less than compared to somewhere like Billings, but I was there about two years ago when a meth lab blew up a couple blocks away - no thanks). There's really nothing to do in Spokane. No culture. Pay is lower than in major cities on the West Coast. Not really any good food.

This is a hashtag thats actually becoming pretty popular. Spokane has really changed in the past ten years. It's really a nice city now. Every time I go to Vancouver or Seattle I'm reminded why I like Spokane so much. Our "bad traffic" is nothing compared to a big city. I like our small big city

[–]jamar030303 2 points 23 hours ago* 
I dunno. Every time I go to Vancouver I'm reminded of how little Spokane has to offer on the international dining scene, and how much that little bit costs. But Spokane is only 3 hours from Missoula; Vancouver is another 7 or 8.

[–]lscheres710 3 points 21 hours ago 
Spokane's food scene is finally getting better. I would say in the past 2 years ive been to more new restaurants then i ever have living here my whole life. Vancouver/portland area is defiantly the mecha for differnt food, i do love the food options there. But spokane is trying, you actually have some choices for good local food spots where as a few years ago it was red robin or applebees lol. But when you factor the price of living over there versus here is the food really worth it? Just make something good yourself. My $100k house would have been $190k or more in a decent neighborhood in Vancouver. I would be living in a dump if i lived over there

Vancouver/portland area
Ah, we're not thinking of the same Vancouver, then. I meant YVR. Plenty of places to get a filling and pretty darn good Chinese or Japanese meal for less than C$10 all-in up north. Not so much in Spokane (I'd pay just about anything to find a place that does decent Hainan chicken rice in Spokane).
Also, all you can eat fish and chips up north for less than C$20. Can't find that down in PDX.

[–]lscheres710 2 points 20 hours ago 
Ahhh yeah that happens sometimes. I haven't been to Canada since i was a young boy. Im not really picky on prices of food. Ill pay whatever for a good quality local meal. For Chinese Spokane is hit or miss at most places. There a few good ones but they have their bad and good nights. Im not picky with Chinese food so im not the best judge in that area. For good american food, try out any of out local breweries. No li is ok, My favorite is Wadells up on Francis ave

[–]Needbouttreefiddy 2 points 19 hours ago 
Kays Teriyaki is decent.

[–]Pull_Out_Method 2 points 16 hours ago 
Vancouver is unique in that the population is 50 percent asian in areas. Good asian food would be expected with those sort of numbers. Also the standard price for a detached home up in the Vancouver area is 1.2 million.

What goes on in Missoula?

[–]jamar030303 1 point 20 hours ago* 
I go to school here. Not a whole lot, which is why I usually jump at any chance to leave town. For example, when a friend wants to drive to Spokane to go shopping, or visiting people I know in Vancouver.

[–]Warhorse07 1 point 20 hours ago 
Well looking at Google Maps it looks like you got a lot of bars in Missoula, so there's that :)

[–]avboden[S] 1 point 21 hours ago 
Spokane has incredible Thai, japanese and korean.

[–]jamar030303 2 points 20 hours ago 
I'd love to know where. I tried one Japanese place in Spokane so far (Sushi Maru, in that mall near the Apple Store) and was not exactly impressed.

[–]blockhead123 1 point 20 hours ago

[–]phryggian 6 points 23 hours ago 
I've been in Spokane for 5 years now and I can say this:
There are places a lot worse. Especially if you go toward the southeastern Deliverance states.

[–]nssdrone 1 point 16 hours ago 
Yeah to me Spokane is just kinda, meh... I shouldn't complain. So glad I don't live in Seattle or Portland, too big for me. I like hiking, camping, and skiing, and we aren't too far from mountains and hills and lakes ( could be closer, but I'll live )
I think to me the ideal location would be Bend, Oregon aside from the higher cost of living

[–]ProfitOfRegret 9 points 1 day ago 
Spokane has many faults, chief among them that it is the source of all human woe - a cleft in the wounded crust of the world that grants Satan and his twisted lieutenants easy access.

[–]NPPraxis 17 points 22 hours ago 
To be fair, Penny Arcade's descriptions of Spokane are pretty accurate about Spokane in the 90's.

[–]ITS_A_GUNDAAAM 1 point 16 hours ago 
And the 2000s for the most part. When I graduated high school in 2006 I knew almost no one who was going to stay in Spokane, we all headed for either Seattle or just clear across the country.

[–]avboden[S] 6 points 1 day ago 
I live just west of spokane on 50 acres, there's tons of relatively affordable plots of varying size just west of spokane, many of which are already set up for horse ownership. Definitely great for horses just outside of the city.

[–]honeylove 2 points 15 hours ago 
Bought 5-acres on Silver Lake with a great view, nice house (5k+ sq), barn, veggie garden, fruit trees, etc. for less than half of what we sold our house for in LA (very modest house). Just started a family, so it is pretty ideal. We love it here. The freedom, privacy, friendliness, and nature are unreal. We've had moose eating our willow trees outside our bedroom window for the last few weeks. Deer are literally everywhere. Canadian geese use the lake during their migration in both directions. I drive about 8-10 minutes to work to a job I love. There is a lot to turn your nose up at if you go looking long enough, but that applies to any city. We have a lot of poverty here, there is no escaping that simple fact, and people love to bash the poor. Because fuck em, right? I do it too and I catch myself and I feel like a complete shitbag. For example, I went to Walmart the other day (I know...), and there was an obese woman in her power cart in front of me in line. In my head I was trashing her, her food choices, her lifestyle...and then she turned around, noticed I only had one item, and in the sweetest way possible let me go ahead. It was a small act of kindness on her part, but in contrast to my hating, it made me the despicable, loathsome one. I think that's basically how people arrive at the 'Spokane Sucks' mentality. But that's fine because the area is the best kept secret and I'd rather it stay that way.

[–]nssdrone 1 point 16 hours ago 
I live in the west plains area. How far just outside the city are you, and do you have to commute for work? I'm always curious what people who live further out in the country do for work, as I'm unhappy with my "career" and also love having elbow room for property

[–]avboden[S] 1 point 16 hours ago 
I'm just about a 20 minute drive from downtown, it's not bad at all. Well I should say that's where I grew up, i'm in graduate school elsewhere now but my parents commute daily and I did for school for most of my life.

[–]Blackagar-Boltagon 13 points 1 day ago* 
I love living here. Born and raised. Have a 5 month old daughter, and am a home owner. I never feel unsafe here, I am pretty sure the hate for Spokane stems from bored teenagers too lazy to go to one of the thousands of outdoor attractions we have near by.

[–]Piesfilledwithpeas 3 points 1 day ago 
I am none of those things, and gave the city a fair chance since I was considering moving there. I mean different strokes for different folks, but I do not think the outdoor attractions make up for its negatives, especially when it's cold as balls 8 months out of the year. But, that's just like...my opinion, man.

[–]Needbouttreefiddy 5 points 1 day ago 
LOL it was 80+ for like 8 months. Cold as balls for maybe two weeks last winter

[–]Piesfilledwithpeas 2 points 1 day ago 
This year, sure. Is that the norm, or was the entire pacific region experiencing prolonged heat? everybody realizes that other people not loving your hometown is not a personal attack right?

[–]blockhead123 2 points 21 hours ago 
It's been like this for awhile now. Snow just doesn't stick in Spokane anymore.

[–]Chuurp 2 points 16 hours ago 
Uh, it sure as hell did from 2008-2012 when I was in school there. Especially 08-09 winter. That was ridiculous.

[–]Blackagar-Boltagon 6 points 1 day ago 
This year it was "warm as balls" for nearly 9 months. Having all four Seasons is another thing I enjoy. I could see winter being no fun to some. Other than outdoor activities we also have some of the best pizza restaurants I have ever been to, and we have 10's of them. Also a fast growing local beer / brewery scene, as well as plenty of wineries too. As you said though, different strokes. My point I guess was I just don't get the "extreme" hate that people express for Spokane.

[–]Piesfilledwithpeas 2 points 1 day ago 
I don't have extreme hate, I just did not like it there or the people I met there.

[–]nssdrone 1 point 16 hours ago

So far, Flying Goat is hands down the best for me (and it's brother, Republic Pi), so I'm curious what others you like?

[–]Blackagar-Boltagon 1 point 14 hours ago 
As you said, no one beats flying goat so far. My other favorite spots are Republic Pi (South Hill), McClains (Division and Hawthorne; the I buffalo chicken pizza is one of my favorites), Boiler Room (5 mile area; a bit pricey), there are two that I can't remember the name, one is a fancy looking place in downtown area (pricey) , and the other is in Browns Addition that has like comic books all over their walls.

[–]nssdrone 2 points 13 hours ago 
Forgot about boiler room. Half price on Sunday I believe. Amazing pizza there too, love the Thai chicken pizza.
And the one in Brown's addition is Pacific avenue pizza.
There's also south Perry pizza

[–]Blackagar-Boltagon 1 point 13 hours ago 
Have have not been to Perry yet! My wife and I talked about heading out there a couple weeks ago, it's pretty good?

Over the course of a year, the temperature typically varies from 21°F to 85°F and is rarely below 5°F or above 94°F.
The warm season lasts from June 19 to September 10 with an average daily high temperature above 74°F. The hottest day of the year is July 30, with an average high of 85°F and low of 58°F.
The cold season lasts from November 14 to February 24 with an average daily high temperature below 42°F. The coldest day of the year is December 28, with an average low of 21°F and high of 31°F.

My wife went to UW for a year so I spent a lot of time in the Seattle area. We both love it, but we couldn't deal with the long commutes and traffic full time.

My live was spent crossing that God damn bridge between Microsoft and home in Seattle. 45 minutes to go like 10 miles.

[–]fauno15 1 point 20 hours ago 
I work at Microsoft and live in Bellevue to make my commute as short as possible. I was offered a job at Amazon at the same time, but it came down to the facts that I didn't want to live in Seattle proper (I'm a Sammamish suburbs kid) and didn't want to commute across the lake.

[–]o5mfiHTNsH748KVq 1 point 17 hours ago 
Man I almost moved to Bellevue just to avoid the traffic. I looked at one of those towers with Windows and stuff right around the corner from Lincoln Square. I almost did it but was hesitant to live in what felt like a Microsoft internment camp.... albeit luxury. In fact, I think it was one of the buildings Microsoft shoves people in the process of relocating.
Fun Fact: I keep calling Lincoln Circle, in Manhattan, Lincoln Square and every time people look at me like I'm an idiot :(

[–]Bruce500 0 points 20 hours ago 
For me it comes from getting lost in the wrong neighborhood in North Spokane while on my way to The Hop.

[–]NPPraxis 1 point 16 hours ago 
$325/mo for a downtown studio apartment with parking and utilities (water/sewer/garbage) included. Some of the cheapest electricity prices in the country due to it being all hydro. Free downtown WiFi network. Tons of under-$100k houses in decent neighborhoods.
It's really darn affordable.

[–]nssdrone 1 point 16 hours ago 
I'm not so sure about how I feel about downtown. The roads suck ass at any speed. Even driving around the block downtown makes me wanna go postal when I have to drive across the rutted cross streets in my small car. What do you like about downtown? I guess the park is cool...

Isn't it possible they also had a part in ruining their lives by choosing to break a law? I don't get this idea that people only follow the laws they like. I'm all for legalization, but why are people surprised when the break the law and get punised?

[–]murricane19 12 points 20 hours ago* 
Have you ever went over the speed limit? Have you ever ran a stop sign or red light? Have you ever sung happy birthday in a crowded place? Have you ever made a friendly wager between friends? Did you ever drink before turning 21? Did you smoke a cigarette before turning 18? Did you look at pornography before turning 18?
These things are all illegal. You belong in jail or at the very least ticketed and fined. And hopefully (since we all think following the law is ALWAYS good) you will now be unemployable, you monster!

[–]ProgressivelyGhetto 1 point 19 hours ago 
That's not what he's arguing though. If a cop catches me speeding, I expect to receive a ticket because I broke the law, and every time I speed I willingly accept the fact that I may get caught. I'm under 18, and if I were to drink or smoke I'd understand that I'm taking a big risk, and that being caught would likely have very negative effects (which some could consider running a life, seeing as my dream college could decline to accept me, an otherwise good student, for having minor possession of alcohol charges on my record.) All those things you listed, people understand and willingly disobey the law, knowing that they could get caught and have negative effects. So do people who smoke/possess/sell weed, so it is their fault they're "ruining their lives." And this is coming from an advocate for the legalization of weed (I even wrote my term paper on why the illegality of weed doesn't make any fucking sense).

[–]murricane19 3 points 19 hours ago 
We are saying the same thing. He was saying that laws should be followed because they are laws. I'm arguing that some laws are dumb and/or outdated. Do people deserve having their lives ruined over any of this stuff? No. Are the laws moral? No. Should we be actively working to change these laws and make sure that we pardon the people who got screwed over? YES.
And yes, I'm advocating breaking these laws on principle. If people didn't actively fight against non-sense that was "against the law" where would be as a society? Do you think Rosa Parks breaking the laws of her time was a good or bad thing? It's the same principle.

[–]ProgressivelyGhetto 0 points 16 hours ago 
The guy you replied to wasn't saying that laws should be followed because they're laws, he was saying you can't be surprised if your life is ruined by breaking these laws. He wasn't saying these laws are moral/good/you shouldn't break them, he just said if your life is ruined because you're caught breaking one of these laws, the blame is entirely on you.
It is your opinion that prohibiting the use/possession/sale/distribution of marijuana is immoral. If everyone broke the laws the found immoral, the country would go to shit. Plain and simple. Our government, and most government really, is founded on the principal that you give up some sovereignty, some of your power, and give it to the country/government as a collective, so you can all be controlled by a single, fair government. The whole point of this social contract is you lose some to get some, and disobeying the laws you don't like is basically breaking the social contract.
Breaking laws on principle can be important, and the civil rights movement was incredibly effective in the long run. However, comparing marijuana to the basic human rights violations, murder by criminal factions (KKK), and discrimination against a whole race just doesn't make sense. That's like comparing a verbal argument and murder.

[–]murricane19 1 point 15 hours ago 
You know, I would 100% agree with you if I didn't know the history behind our marijuana laws. The entire intent of marijuana prohibition was the disenfranchisement of 'undesirables' (i.e. Minorities). Yes, I chose an extreme example but please do some research on why the laws exist in the first place.

No doubt. I think people bitch about Spokane because it doesn't have all the flashy shit Seattle has. Our downtown isn't a glitzy, but my standard of living isn't worse because of it. If anything, it's a bit higher - I can afford a brand new luxury apartment and commute 10 minutes to work. I can bike 10 minutes and end up in a forest.

Maybe because of the unbelievable lack of opertunity and completely stagnant economy. Not to mention the fact that for a relatively small city it is nationally renowned for a meth and roxy epidemic that is, until just recently, starting to subside a little bit. I could go on about the record breaking car theft, Russian mafia and that it has the highest per capita cases of MS in the country.. But, I guess housing is cheap and if you're they're to do border line nothing and stay in the few and far between decent areas it's okay.

Nice start. Now finish the job by vacating ALL drug convictions. Start treating drug addiction as a medical/psychological problem and not as a crime.
"Vices are those acts by which a man harms himself or his property. Crimes are those acts by which one man harms the person or property of another. Vices are simply the errors which a man makes in his search after his own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice toward others, and no interference with their persons or property."

Nice start. Now finish the job by vacating ALL drug convictions. Start treating drug addiction as a medical/psychological problem and not as a crime.
"Vices are those acts by which a man harms himself or his property. Crimes are those acts by which one man harms the person or property of another. Vices are simply the errors which a man makes in his search after his own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice toward others, and no interference with their persons or property."
Lysander Spooner, Vices Are Not Crimes

[–]PM_ME_UR_OBSIDIAN 3 points 22 hours ago 
One issue with addiction is that it can cause harm to society. In a social democracy with free healthcare, addiction is a public concern because it Costs Money to the public. And some addicts "drop out" of society, steal, defraud, etc.
Addiction is a sickness which is both expensive to society and partially determined by social factors, like (for example) obesity and depression. We don't criminalize junk food and stress, so we shouldn't criminalize drugs; but we as a society need an effective strategy to tackle these woes.

[–]Splenda 2 points 17 hours ago 
The Dutch have a more effective approach to addicts, treating them as medical rather than criminal problems, as the previous poster suggests. I've seen it up close, and it seems to work.

[–]Cannabis_warrior 1 point 20 hours ago 
Addiction causes less harm than fines jail time and preemptive self defense against 'dangerous' drug users.

[–]jamesneysmith 1 point 17 hours ago 
You can't say that for certain. It's fair to say they are both bad and the former should be treated compassionately instead of criminally.

[–]illusorycrab 1 point 19 hours ago 
What does addiction have to do with it? Addiction has never been a considered a crime, it's all about possession.
Wanting to take drugs because they're enjoyable isn't an illness, it's an activity. It's also a choice which people make despite being aware of the legal risk.
One thing a lot of people neglect to mention when they support drug (mainly weed) legalisation is that they just want to be able to do drugs without repercussions. It's a largely selfish motivation.

[–]CoffeeAndKarma 4 points 1 day ago 
I don't get why this doesn't happen anyways. If I'm convicted of something and that thing stops being illegal, why should I have to stay in jail and keep a criminal record? I haven't done anything illegal!

[–]AlmennDulnefni 3 points 1 day ago 
Applying laws retroactively is not necessarily good. I sure wouldn't want to be convicted of a crime that wasn't criminal when I committed it. And that is explicitly not allowed to happen. I think that it it probably usually a good idea to retroactively apply decriminalization, but I'm fine with that being handled separately from the decriminalization itself.

[–]CoffeeAndKarma 2 points 1 day ago 
Totally agree. Even if it does take a separate process, it should happen.

[–]ChronaMewX 1 point 1 day ago 
Adding punishments retroactively is wrong, but I see no problem with retroactively removing punishments for things that are no longer crimes. It's in the interest of a free society, there are way too many people in jail who don't deserve to be there

[–]AlmennDulnefni 1 point 23 hours ago 
Right. As I said, I think it is generally a good idea to apply decriminalization retroactively. I'm not entirely certain that every decriminalization should be universally retroactively applied and that there doesn't exist a situation where it might be better not to, so I think it is fine to not mandate it. But I suppose any such situation is probably much rarer than the ones where it ought to apply retroactively but doesn't without appeal if at all. Maybe it ought to be automatic.

Ex post facto laws (making something illegal retroactively) explicit violate the US Constitution.

"It was illegal when you did it!"
Yeah, but we decided that it's wrong to label someone a criminal for this conduct.
"You don't have to wear an ugly shirt forever just because it seemed like a good idea when you put it on."

[–]ImA90sChick 0 points 20 hours ago 
but we decided that it's wrong
To be honest, most of Eastern Washington is actually very conservative and was against the decriminalization of marijuana (they are still against it, from what I understand). Basically, I-502 only passed because of the sheer number of voters from Western Washington, and more specifically the Seattle area. It's not representative of the views of the whole state.
So Seattle people decided it was wrong, but Eastern Washington still generally believes possession of marijuana (and selling, even on a retail level) should be a crime.
So... no. Social attitude change does not move as quickly in real life as you like to think.

[–]mutatersalad1 1 point 18 hours ago 
That's not really true.

[–]ImA90sChick 1 point 16 hours ago 
How so?

[–]mutatersalad1 1 point 18 hours ago 
It depends on what law it is. You're fundamentally incorrect in your idea of how it should work, though in this specific case you happen to be right.
If we repealed a law simply because it was too costly/a less effective way to stop people from doing something wrong, then we should still keep those people in prison, because what they did was wrong in and of itself. In this incident, smoking weed is not a morally wrong act by itself, and the law was unjust, and that is why they should have their records scrubbed.

[–]CoffeeAndKarma 1 point 17 hours ago 
I agree with you there. I should have been more specific, but it didn't occur to me at the time of posting.

[–]Rogue100 4 points 21 hours ago

Non-American here - what would happen to all of those who have been incarcerated for Cannabis charges?

[–]avboden[S] 5 points 1 day ago 
This is only for misdemeanor possession, basically a ticket that goes on your record, no one was put in jail for that. People with worse things, selling, etc that saw jail time won't have any change.

[–]Neon-Disease 2 points 23 hours ago 
If you're waiting for the government to compensate people for punishments that we now realize shouldn't have been given out in the first place, you'll be waiting a LOOOOOOONG time.

[–]seager 0 points 23 hours ago 
Sounds kinda familiar.
More like - does everyone in prison for minor possession charges just get released? Simple way of looking at it for sure.

[–]Hard_at_it 1 point 1 day ago 
I wonder how that would work with private data retention.
Google caching public records, media & newspaper articles. What about college/university admissions? Could those denied have their rejection expunged and apply without prejudice.
Then there is companies like HireRight that store data on their servers, a past "hit" could remain.
Nevertheless it's a great start, but there is still many ways a past convicted person can be haunted.

[–]ManganeseOxide 2 points 23 hours ago

[–]jesscharr 1 point 21 hours ago

[–]kiseraitpa 1 point 17 hours ago 
It feels weird to remember that it was 3 years ago. It still took a while before the first stores went in, and even longer before any real competition started to occur. Now, there are giant billboards announcing "The Northwest's Premier Recreational Marijuana Store!" It's crazy that just 20 miles away it's still illegal and can land you in jail.

[–]skazzbomb 1 point 9 hours ago 
Not even 20. I live on the Border and it's not even 5 miles from Idaho to "Weed Way" on Trent where there's like 5 or 6 dispensaries lol.

[–]sup_g 2 points 18 hours ago 
I wonder what the fee will be for this -- this marijuana legalization thing could be a cash cow for things like this.

Good. Things like this can affect professional licensing, loans for education, job applications, security checks, licenses for firearms and hunting. It's a huge list.
Live and let live. None of this should have been illegal to start with, we certainly should not punish people for it, and certainly not lifetime punishments

I've never been to a nicer hotel than the Davenport and the prices are fantastic! Your selection for shopping is just amazing and the prices are equally fantastic! There are so many things to see and do there and there isn't anywhere I'd rather go within an eight hour drive of Calgary for a great vacation!

[–]Arwizzel 5 points 22 hours ago 
Just watched a rerun of cops yesterday that was in Spokane. They arrested this kid for having two big-ass bags of weed on him. All I could think while watching was that they potentially ruining this kids life over a plant. Further, the cop was acting all sanctimonious as though he was saving the world from the evils of drugs. Of course, it was probably recorded in the early 90s, so that makes sense.

[–]firebat45 -2 points 19 hours ago 
The kid was ruining his own life by being a drug traficker and/or mule. Whether or not pot should be legal is a completely different discussion, at that point it was not legal and that kid was obviously not busted for having one joint for personal smoking. There's illegal drug trade even for legal drugs (like oxy). Just because the drug itself may or may not be harmful doesn't mean illegal drug dealers are good people.

[–]Arwizzel 5 points 19 hours ago 
haha I have seen dudes go through that much smoke in my time, doesn't mean it was for distribution. Conversely, having an illicit substance that may or may not be harmful doesn't mean illegal drug dealers are inherently evil, either.

People break the law all the time. Speeding, jaywalking, copyright infringement, etc. There are a lot of stupid laws that people ignore in the hopes that they don't get caught. It's just that past drug convictions tend to prevent people from getting a job, and now that's it's legal it shouldn't have any bearing on their current employability.

Drug users come in all colors and social classes, so this move makes sense. However, drug dealers tend mostly to come from poor backgrounds and are disproportionately racial minorities. So, of course they're not going to keep punishing someone for buying a product that is now legal, but they'll still keep punishing people for selling a product that is now legal.
Racism is one of those things, no matter how many times a day you're confronted with it, it never gets any less ugly.

People knew the risks when they broke the law and they decided the risk was worth it. I think it sends the "right" kind of message that it should not be consequence free to ignore the law but it also isn't right to have a benign infraction follow you for the rest of your life, or at all in my opinion.

I really hope other states continue to do things like his. Maybe we can shame my home state of Louisiana into doing better.

[–]icannevertell 1 point 1 day ago 
This is awesome, I had hoped we'd see things like this. My parents live near there, and I can't wait to hear how this is another one of Obama Bin Laden's plots to undermine America.

[–]DiZeez 1 point 1 day ago 
Fair enough, considering the legalization and the low risk type of violation in the first place.

[–]AngloQuebecois 1 point 20 hours ago 
Cool, but let me know when they vacate all felony possession convictions.

[–]mlk960 1 point 20 hours ago 
Not that I'm entirely against this, but is it going to release a lot people who were arrested for marijuana possession because they couldn't be arrested for bigger things?

[–]smittyjones -5 points 23 hours ago 
Not that I really care about marijuana at all, but why?
It was still a crime when they were convicted or whatever.
If I get a speeding ticket for going 45 in a 35, but they later raise the speed limit to 45 on that road, do I get that ticket taken off of my record?

[–]avboden[S] 18 points 22 hours ago 
Because the simple misdemeanor prevents people from renting apartments and getting jobs, it's a humanitarian issue. Speeding ticket? not so much

[–]smittyjones -3 points 17 hours ago 
Speeding tickets aren't without their repercussions. It would raise your insurance premiums for a speed limit that shouldn't have been the speed limit, similar (yet potentially less severe) situation, but it doesn't work that way for a driver.

[–]inpu 10 points 21 hours ago 
Would you feel the same about people convicted for homosexuality before it was legal? Sometimes, the law is just wrong, and causes harm instead of preventing or alleviating it. The least the government can do, after realizing such a situation, is try to make amends by clearing convictions of people convicted under such unjust laws.

[–]illusorycrab -5 points 19 hours ago 
Did you seriously just equate willingly taking an illegal drug of your own accord with being born gay?

[–]inpu 9 points 19 hours ago 
I am in fact kind of equating taking a drug, in accordance with your right to self-ownership, with having gay sex. A lot of people are claiming that while you're born gay, having gay sex is still a choice and sinful. Fact is, it's a victimless crime, just like taking drugs. It would be cruel to punish somebody for acting on their love for another (consenting) human being, and it is also cruel to punish somebody for the just as victimless and private act of putting a potentially unhealthy substance into their own body.
But that's not even the crux of my argument; my argument is that sometimes, the law is wrong. About all kinds of stuff. And when it is wrong, it needs to be fixed, and the damage done by the unjust law needs to be fixed as far as possible. The law has no value in itself. If you followed the law in Nazi Germany, chances are you did something wrong, for example by denouncing hiding Jews. The argument, "but it was the law then" just isn't a very good one.

[–]illusorycrab -3 points 19 hours ago 
The argument, "but it was the law then" just isn't a very good one.
It actually is. I used to be like you, thinking it was my place as a rational and sensible citizen to decide which laws were or weren't just. That is until I realised the laws weren't aimed at me, but at curtailing certain behaviours in the population on a large scale. The law has value simply by being the law. It doesn't make much rational sense, but rules and laws are a natural part of human group dynamics which exist in every culture.
If you don't want to abide by the law then fair enough, but don't try to justify it to anybody else or argue with it. The law is the law, and if that makes you feel powerless then surprise surprise, you are powerless. By living within society you entered a contract in which your complete subjugation to the law is unarguable.

[–]inpu 4 points 19 hours ago 
I don't see how that is an argument at all. I think it's terrible, and can be used to justify any sort of tyranny. The law does not have any value simply by being the law. History has proven that beyond any doubt again and again.

[–]illusorycrab -3 points 19 hours ago 
The thing you need to realize is that it isn't an argument. It's the law. That's just how the world works. Welcome.
As I said earlier you're free to break it whenever you like.

[–]inpu 5 points 19 hours ago 
The world and the law are what we make of it. It changes all the time. And when we notice it has been bad in the past, we try to make up for it and help the people who have been hurt. That's human empathy. That is also how the world works. In fact, empathy predates any law, it is older than any legal codex. The law is just a means to an end, to codify empathy and prevent people from harming others. Whenever it does not serve that end, it can be ignored, and should be changed, and the people harmed by the unjust law need to be helped to overcome the damage that this injustice has done to them. And stop telling me what "I need to realize." It's not like this is the first time I've though about those things, and it's not like I'm the only one to think like this, by far.

[–]illusorycrab -3 points 19 hours ago 
The world and the law are what we make of it.
No, "we" are just citizens. It's our place to go about our lives within the limitations of the law, but we are not lawmakers.
The law isn't just about stopping harm, it's the direct hand of societal cohesion used by lawmakers to enforce their vision of the world on society. If the law is sufficiently unjust then there are natural mechanisms in place to fight it (voting, protest, revolution and war).
I don't really expect you to understand this though, much less agree with it as we've had over 300 years of post-Enlightenment fetishization of the rights of the individual. People are too individualistic these days to understand why they should be subjugated to the law.

[–]sonofherb 3 points 17 hours ago 
If the law is sufficiently unjust then there are natural mechanisms in place to fight it (voting, protest, revolution and war).
Yeah, one of those mechanisms of protest is civil disobedience. You know, like /exactly/ how the Civil Rights movement worked at waking the complacent majority up to the fact that stuff wasn't how it should be.

[–]Wustapen 1 point 16 hours ago 
But here in this case, the law is now like it never was... interesting.

[–]illusorycrab 1 point 9 hours ago 
You think I don't realise that? Whether you think the law is just or liable to change is irrelevant, the fact is it's the law and you as a citizen have to follow it. If you break it, you pay the punishment.

[–]Wustapen [score hidden] 1 minute ago 
Again, interesting how they decided not to follow this line of thinking with this particular law. Government in Spokane thinks it was a bad idea and they are trying to fix it. They disagree with you in this instance and so do I.

[–]letsbebuns 5 points 19 hours ago 
The argument is apt. In both examples, somebody is being jailed (being kidnapped, freedom taken away) for engaging in an activity that doesn't harm anybody else.

[–]illusorycrab -2 points 19 hours ago 
One is a choice, the other is not.
You wouldn't say that tripping and stepping on a baby's head was equal to purposefully stamping on its head would you? Both results are the same, but the punishment takes into account the intention.

[–]letsbebuns 1 point 13 hours ago 
It doesn't matter if it's a choice, it's still taking away someone's freedom. Freedom is the issue.

[–]illusorycrab 1 point 9 hours ago 
Well duh, freedom is the one thing we all have to take away. What else would you rather the law take from us? Our hands?

[–]clush -4 points 20 hours ago 
I'm all for legalization, but yeah... You broke the law when the law was active. Just because rules are changed doesn't mean you should get off on past arrests.

[–]Wustapen 3 points 16 hours ago 
If the law was stupid and not in the best interest of the American public in the first place then yes, yes it should.

[–]clush -2 points 15 hours ago 
Doesn't change the fact that it's still a law and breaking laws have consequences.

[–]Wustapen 2 points 15 hours ago 
And they did, until Washington pulled it's head out of it's ass and now they are fixing some of the lives they ruined with this ridiculous prohibition. It was a law, now they think it shouldn't have been.

[–]ishkabibbles84 0 points 1 day ago 
Does that mean they will refund them the price of said misdemeanor ticket as well?

[–]sheizlegend 0 points 1 day ago 
I bet this won't work for every resident. Then they'll all move to Phoenix, like they always do. They'll bring their driving and methamphetamine with them.

[–]Nick12506 0 points 17 hours ago 
They still took the money from those cases. It's either refund all those people the money they the court forced them to pay or leave it on the records. It's literally bribery.

[–]MrMischiefVIP -2 points 17 hours ago 
So 3 people will be affected? I'm pretty sure most people in Spokane do meth, not marijuana.

[–]Lokismoke -12 points 1 day ago 
Awesome, Spokane has way worse problems to worry about anyways.
Once, I drove there to pick up a friend from the bus station. The van next to my vehicle in the parking lot had large windows and looked like one of those vans you could live in that the hippie kid in your high school dreamt about. Like this. It also had curtains in front of the windows.
So, every ten minutes or so, a vehicle would park, the person would get out, climb in the back of the van, and I could see the distinct visual of a lighter being lit inside the van. This happened for 30, 40 minutes with pretty normal looking people in business suits and the like. Just normal people getting high off of meth or crack or something in a drug van after work and before going home.
Also, Spokane's entire infrastructure has barely been updated since the 1970's.

[–]avboden[S] 18 points 1 day ago 
haven't been by Spokane in a while have you? There has been a massive increase in infrastructure, especially downtown. Huge convention center upgrades, massive new hotels, giant conventions bringing millions into the local economy, new apartments everywhere, riverfront park is getting a $60million revamp etc. The economy is on the up and up, the valley has exploded, basically just north is still having real issues.
The roads still suck, sure, but we have literally the worst possible climate with the freeze/thaw cycle for roads, it's impossible to keep them nice.

[–]waaaghbosss 2 points 1 day ago 
Well, refunding one of your two pothole crews will do that for you :(

[–]Needbouttreefiddy 1 point 16 hours ago 
When you say just north, I'm not sure what you mean? Are you talking Hillyard? If so, there is a hell of a lot more up North than Hillyard. Wanderemere is one of the nicest areas of Spokane. Mead is one of the best school districts, etc..

[–]avboden[S] 1 point 16 hours ago 
Oh totally, I wasn't lumping everything together, just saying in general the areas immediately north of downtown are some of the more....run down areas now

[–]Lokismoke -2 points 1 day ago 
Yeah, I admit it's been like two years since I've been there for any substantial period of time.

[–]NPPraxis 1 point 22 hours ago 
Spokane's changed a lot lately. Huge new near-downtown developments with a ton of stores and restaurants (like Kendall Yards), tons of new things to do and entertainment, lots more bars, expansion of the park downtown, more apartments.
Now we just need to do something about the decaying old Ridpath building and it'll feel ultramodern.
Seriously, I hated Spokane 4-5 years ago, but it's pretty nice now.

[–]revcon 1 point 20 hours ago 
did you know the ridpath was purchased last year? they are remodeling it now and its expected to open up next year as microapartments

[–]NPPraxis 1 point 20 hours ago 
Is it? Because it's been "repurchased" like 3-4 times in the last decade.
A group purchased it in 2006 to turn it in to apartments. They got foreclosed on in 2008.
In 2012, a group of developers planned to turn it in to an "entertainment mecca" hotel.
Then a developer named Ron Wells purchased part of it in 2013 to turn it in to apartments.
Then in 2014 Washington Trust purchased a part of it to turn it in to offices.
In 2015 Ron Wells is still giving interviews about how he plans to remodel it when his loans come through.
I'm really skeptical about any articles I see claiming it will be opening soon. It'd be nice, but I've been hearing about it for years and everyone seems to go bankrupt when they start working on a remodel. I'm pretty sure half the building has been invaded by homeless people.

[–]revcon 1 point 20 hours ago 
yeah, im pretty sure construction started a couple months ago. i've seen workers in and out since i have an office next door. a lot of the condos have already been sold and apartments waitlisted. this article puts construction completion at feb '16 but im sure it will be delayed as usual with ridpath projects. they also recently fixed the sign which is fun!

[–]NPPraxis 1 point 20 hours ago 
That's awesome! I'm excited to see it finish then :) I think it'll dramatically change the feel of downtown. Hopefully we'll see more restaurants/bars/shops appear there too, there's a ton of barred-up spaces on the ground level for it.

[–]revcon 1 point 20 hours ago 
same! it's a chunk of town that has a ton of potential, i really hope everything goes according to plan.

[–]Blackagar-Boltagon 1 point 1 day ago 
Drive passed the bus station. The North end of Downtown up to Wandermere (Northside of town) has changed drastically in the last 10 or 15 years. More so in the last 5.

[–]firebat45 -3 points 20 hours ago 
That's dumb. I'm all for legalizing pot (even though I have never and will never smoke it) but they broke the law. Law changed after the fact, but it remains that they broke the law. Even though it's legal now doesn't mean their disregard for the law should be forgotten.
Let potential landlords/employers decide if a marijuana conviction matters to them. To me, it shows bad decision making and disrespect for authority.

[–]SneakFromSeattle 3 points 18 hours ago 
Thank God your opinion on the matter is irrelevant.

[–]firebat45 -2 points 18 hours ago 
Just like every other opinion in this thread. It's a discussion, calm down. Go smoke a joint or something.

[–]SneakFromSeattle 3 points 17 hours ago 
Just cause it's your opinion doesn't mean that it isn't wrong.
Will do, bruh.

[–]firebat45 -2 points 17 hours ago 
Yup, you got me. There shouldn't be any consequences for breaking the law, nobody should be held accountable for anything, and the government is out to get you. Want to know how I knew you were one of those militant potheads?
If someone is dumb enough to get caught with pot back when it was illegal, they deserve to have that on their record. It's a warning to future landlords and employers. "Caution, this person is a dumb shit who feels above the law, and furthermore, can't even keep their illegal habits private."

[–]SneakFromSeattle 3 points 17 hours ago 
Damn, bro. You're super upset about this.
Thanks for your opinion though :)
takes fatty rips of the bong 420 blazeit

[–]Wustapen 1 point 16 hours ago 
Or it could have just been bad luck to get caught.

[–]firebat45 1 point 7 hours ago 
Luck is what you make it. People with "bad luck" are usually bad at planning, have poor skills, or are just lazy. It's exceedingly easy to never get caught with marijuana. But yeah, if you go out and wander around high, reeking of pot, you're going to have some "bad luck".

[–]sharkman873 -1 points 19 hours ago 
Who gives a fuck? Way to go Spokane for decriminalizing harmful drugs and contributing to the degradation of health in our society

[–]Wustapen 1 point 16 hours ago 
What harmful drugs are you taking about? Wrong thread?

[–]WifehasDID -2 points 21 hours ago 
This I disagree with, the law was well known and people chose to ignore the law.
The record is there to show that this person was willing to ignore the law

[–]drhugs 3 points 20 hours ago 
What is law, and what is just, do not have a 100% overlap.

[–]WifehasDID 1 point 19 hours ago 
Being punished for supporting criminal enterprises is just...

[–]LibAtheist 3 points 20 hours ago 
People like you are terrifying. You would support the jailing of people like Rosa Parks and think they should face life long repercussions. These laws also have nothing to do with justice. Hell our current president smoked weed and did cocaine and nobody gives a fuck.

[–]WifehasDID 1 point 19 hours ago 
LMAO at you comparing weed smokers to Rosa Parks...
Of course someone like you thinks is terrifying you make ignorant connections.
You are the exact person like those at Yale who take some bullshit cause and act like they are Rosa Parks
You take some bullshit and tell yourself you are equal to Rosa Parks and her struggle and it is embarrassing..
You should be embarrassed comparing pot heads who just wanted to get high with Rosa Parks

[–]doorkn00b -3 points 1 day ago 
What ever happened to the principle of ex post facto? You're not innocent of doing something illegal even if the law changes later.

[–]avboden[S] 2 points 23 hours ago 
That's why more serious charges aren't being even considered for this. They are ONLY dropping the absolute lowest level charge possible, misdemeanor possession, because it being on someone's record makes it very hard to even rent an apartment, even with it being legal now.
