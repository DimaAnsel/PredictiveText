I have done this before. I made a mistake when booking a connecting flight. Did not see the AM vs PM on the flights. Was stuck for over seven hours. I walked around a lot...checking out the newsstand stores several times...but mostly people watching. The mix and variety of people at an airport is awesome.

A dog.
A kid on a leash.
A team of some sort traveling together.
A nun or priest. Bonus if both or together.

Kissing?

[–]marquisalex 517 points 6 hours ago 
I figured leg-humping was close enough. Kinda hard for a dog to be running and kissing simultaneously, unless it's a huge dog or a tiny person.

Buy a club pass, they're only like $50.

[–]penner5a 632 points 8 hours ago 
$50 is money well spent if it is 7 hours. No time restrictions?

[–]GoddamnBonafide 504 points 8 hours ago 
A day pass should last for 24 hours. I've never had attendants come around and check each person for how long they've been there though. And new people come on shift every few hours anyway, they're not paying attention to who is there. Theoretically, if you had a 30 hour layover you could buy a day pass and still hang out beyond the 24 hour mark.

[–]a_lumberjack 446 points 7 hours ago 
If the lounge doesn't close, yeah. But with a 30 hour layover, get a cheap airport hotel rate and go explore a city. Not much more money, and you'd have way more fun.

[–]GoddamnBonafide 281 points 7 hours ago 
Well, cab fare to and from the city (assuming there's a shuttle from the airport to your hotel) + food + the hotel would probably bring you over $50.
But it would still be worth it to explore someplace new rather than sit in an airport lounge for 30 hours.

As long as the amount of blood on the club doesn't exceed the 3.4 FL ounces than the TSA allows, or you'll have to have your club checked.

12:00pm: Realize at the gate that connecting flight isn't until 7. Fuck.
12:02pm: Sit down to contemplate your options.
12:03pm: Pull out phone. Dead. Fuck. Put phone back in pocket. Begin contemplating life.
12:04pm: Pull out phone. Still dead. Stare vacantly at one spot wondering if you should be that guy and shave in the bathroom.
12:06pm: Notice that you are staring at a woman only 10 feet away the entire time; and she looks creeped out. Panic. Pretend to fumble for something and pull out sun glasses. Put them on, pretend to be blind.
12:07pm: Suddenly realize that everyone thinks you're blind, so you can't read anything. Consider walking to an area where no one thinks you're blind. No cane; no dog. Fuck. Have to wait until everyone currently here leaves to do anything.
6:40pm: Everyone was waiting for the same flight, thus never moved. Board flight with the assistance of the crew because you "forgot" your cane.

Related story: One time I (as a 30-year-old) was in China and bought a cane for my dad with a badass dragon on it. Unfortunately it wouldn't fit in my baggage, and of course they're not just gonna let you on a plane with a cane if you don't need it.
So I pretended to have a bad knee, and walked slowly and used the cane the whole way home, through a transfer in NYC, to Boston. Got special treatment, offers from people the whole way back to help me with my stuff, etc. Went better than I could've hoped for.
It broke last year while my dad was using it and he threw it out. What a bastard.

We were going on family vacation and had to take a wheelchair for my cousin (who was meeting us in the Dominican from another country). They told us they would charge us for the wheelchair if no one was sitting in it, so I sat in the wheelchair and my aunt pushed me along. Got through security first, on the plane first, was fun times.

I recall seeing one in an airport somewhere, but it's a few years back and I've seen too many to remember which one. I think they also rented out books for you to return after your journey.
It is a brilliant idea, though. Should definitely be more common.

Walk. Walk everywhere. Go to every single shop and fuck around. Try find the most ludicrously expensive watch. Try out all the items in every store. Watch the aeroplanes. Watch all the different people. Dream of where your going. Listen to whole albums of music. Read books. Think a lot.
This doesn't sound like much, but you see awesome stuff. Like at a stop over in Singapore I came across this random elephant stature that was painted like a Ferrari and was signed by the whole Ferrari F1 team.
Airports are great! Just try to enjoy it and not focus on killing time.

[–]AHarderStyle 491 points 5 hours ago 
Last time I was in an airport waiting for my flight, I went to the watches and asked if I could try on the $15,000 watch on. The girl at the counter said she'd need to take my ID to let me wear it, so I totally got to wear a $15,000 dollar watch for like, 45 seconds

Get drunk at the bar.

[–]TRex_N_Truex 1290 points 6 hours ago 
Just for the love of God don't tell anyone that you're drunk. Don't joke to a gate agent or a flight attendant or pilot or anything. We deny boarding to drunk people all the time for safety. If you tell us you're drunk, you put so much liability onto that person and no one ever looks the other way.

[–]camelCaseOrGTFO 471 points 6 hours ago

I sat for about 3 hours at an airport bar and got pretty drunk before getting on my connection. The bartender though I was someone else and kept putting my drinks on their tab. I racked up what I assume to be a hefty bill (probably $75) and simply flew away. I regret it now that I'm older and have a conscience though. At the time it was awesome. Note: I did throw down a $20 for a tip.
Edit- awesome. My highest voted comment is about how I screwed someone over. Couldn't be some high-minded, well thought out comment on how to make the world a better place. So, there you go, Reddit. Steal shit and regret it later. It pays out in karma.

[–]krankie 243 points 5 hours ago 
Been there several times (as a visa portfolio manager, not a bar patron) and it isn't fraud, but rather a dispute. Some use those terms interchangeably but there are rules in place for both types of scenarios that the issuer, the merchant, and the card holder must follow. Most of the time I'd end up eating those extra charges. The merchant is usually in the clear even though they fucked up, and the customer is ALWAYS in the clear because of the zero-liability policy set in place by visa/mc. If customers were liable, that would be very damaging to Visa/MC's market share. That puts most of the liability on merchants and issuers, but especially the issuers. The only recourse an issuer has is to pull their card, close their account, and ban them from future use. But it's really hard to determine whether or not the card holder was being careless, trying to pull one over on the bank, or is just a victim of the circumstances. Either way, extra charges at a bar are hardly ever the card holder's problem as long as they file a dispute with the issuer.

Don't feel too bad!
I once went to a bar in NYC after a concert, with a bunch of hooligans I met at the venue.
Well one guy, Connor, who I didn't really know, bought the 8 of us our first round. So for the second round I gave my close friend my credit card to go order us all another round! He came back, and I assumed had opened me a tab!
So we all drink pretty indiscriminately, for a few more hours, when we realize we have 20 minutes to get 30 blocks to catch the last train. We said our goodbyes, then everyone except Connor, who was a local, rushed out of the bar to get to the station.
Halfway to there, in a cab, I had a realization. "I didn't close my tab!" Then my friend handed me my card and told me he never opened one. The bartender hadn't been charging him!
Well my idiot friend didnt realize that they weren't free drinks. They were all on Connor's tab. And we had just left him there alone.
I'm so sorry Connor.

They'll have problems with security issues. When you are drunk as fuck and going through security/the border, you have to hide it (experience talk here). If there's a nightclub in the airport they will have to deal with people who can't hide any of their shit, and they'll be forced to close within weeks/months.

My trick was to go to the liquor store and pick up a bottle of vodka.
Take note of any vending machines whilst looking for the liquor store.
Buy a soft drink which you will take into the washroom and defile with hard liquor.
Sit out in the common areas and let the party come to you. There's plenty of people watching to be done. You'll be buzzed, so you should have no problem conversing with people. Oh, and let's not forget, you can always play: Let's-see-how-long-I-can-hold-my-pee.

I had a 14 hour layover in Detroit last summer. I did have WiFi, but the connection was shit. For some reason I thought it would be fun to take dinosaur toys with me and take pictures of them in various places inside the airport.
Everything from hiding in the faux bushes, to ordering pizza, to riding the moving sidewalks through crowds.
Even took pictures of them in places we visited in England. The look on people's faces when I laid in the grass to set up dinosaurs in front of Stonehenge was priceless.
EDIT: To prove I'm not some DiGiorno eating Bundle of Sticks I pulled some links from my Tumblr blog I kept while I was over there. The first link is to the archive, scroll to May 2014 for the start of the adventure. If you're lazy, I pulled individual links to each photo.
Hell I even named the dinosaurs.
Professor Perry Soralophus the parasaurolophus.
Lady Guthridge the Brontosaurus.
Paul Anka the Ankylosaur.
Demitri the Triceratops.

As a business traveler with 162k miles in the air Year to date, I do one of several things:
1) I installed ingress. I don't give a shit about the game, but it's turned into a neat tourist guide. Lots of airports have some cool artwork in them.
2) I have a fitbit. If I have over 2 hours between flights, and I don't hit my step count, it's a failure. You don't? use your phone. most of them have pedometers. See how many steps you can get in. beat it on the next layover.
3) Read the economist or New Yorker. every airport has them, they take forever to read, and I've never once finished an issue without feeling more informed.
4) depending on the airport...Drink. You're broke? k, Nevermind.
5) books.

Read a book, eat shitty food...or...make up your own live drama "movie" using strangers as the characters and pretend that they are interacting. My favorite premise is that all of the people around a gate are waiting to find out if they are named in the will of a rich relative/acquaintance...and then make up a back story for everyone. As long as you can control the occasional laughing fit when someone does something that fits perfectly into your show...it's gold!

There is that buzz of the airport too where you can't seem to get settled.
What I did was, walk over to the nearest food area and just stood in the centre of all the tables where people where eating.
I then stood perfectly still and closed my eyes, pretending that I could levitate.
I stood there like that for over and hour before a woman screamed out. "Holy shit is that guy floating?."
I opened my eye's and lo and behold, I was indeed levitating.

If I have my bag with my yarn and crochet hook, I'm set.
The last time I had something similar was waiting in court for five hours. I finished a new scarf design during that time.
ETA: It'll vary by airport, but generally crochet hooks are allowed - I've heard anecdotes that knitting needles cause more issues. Both are available in bamboo or plastic if you can't bring metal through a metal detector. You can't bring in a scissor or snips to cut the yarn, but you can bring nail clippers which'll do in a pinch.
Edit 2: From the TSA site "In general, you may place your knitting needles and needlepoint tools in carry-on or checked baggage.
Circular thread cutters or any other cutter or needlepoint tools that contain blades must be placed in checked baggage. You are permitted to keep scissors smaller than 4 inches in your carry-on baggage.
Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane."

[–]sillybear25 17 points 4 hours ago 
Knitting needles are specifically permitted by TSA rules if I remember correctly. The problem is that TSA employees often don't know the rules they're supposed to be enforcing.

Create a scientific survey. Sit down in a high traffic area. Get a piece a paper and pen. Write down the start time, watch women. Make a hash mark every time you see a hot chick. Do this for 7 hours. Get an average per hour. Write about your findings on the average amount of hot chick's in an airport you'll see within a hour.

Find the bar. Order a beer. Oblige when bartender asks if you would like to get the large sized beer for only 1 dollar more, as well as add on a shot of jack for only 3 dollars. Drink 22oz beer. Drink shot. When tingle sets in, start a conversation with the decently cute man/woman sitting next to you. Order more drinks. Become drunk. Fall in love with man/woman sitting next to you. After 7 hours, consider changing your flight to go home with your new love to meet her/his parents (that's where she/he is going). You are in control of your destiny.

Build a beautiful mosaic fountain in an abandoned terminal and dedicate it to the flight attendant you've fallen in love with. Collect stray shopping carts and return them to the corrals to profit big $$$. Make friends with airport staff including a Hindu janitor who hates Tuesdays and help bring about the marriage of two Trekkie soulmates. I have more, there's a whole movie on it :)

Sit near a charger, plug in my phone, and go crazy. I have unlimited data so wifi is no biggy for me.
HOWEVER! If I did not have service, then I'd walk around, maybe see if they have an arcade area, skim through a magazine, people watch, eat, drink, essentially anything I can think of to keep myself busy.

Anytime I'm at the airport, I've got a book with me. So, I'd 1) read, and 2) read at the bar. It's easier to meet people if you're drinking, and if nobody else is there, you've got your book and (likely) a television - plus the bartender.

I have a tablet that I keep loaded with about 20 hours of TV shows at any given time. I've only run through all of it one time on a round trip flight across the country due to a flight delay and a long layover.

With a 7 hour layover, it's likely a long travel, right?
Depending on the airport:
Go take a nice long shower
Find the good restaurant and have a nice leisurely meal.
Get a nice relaxing massage...some airports have really good massage shops...asia and europe, not so much the US.
If you're in a crappy airport:
Sit in agony on a grubby floor, stare at the wall for hours, and start to become delirious.

I had to do this back in March. 8 hour lay over in Copenhagen. I read mostly, drank coffee, played games on my iPad that didn't require wifi, and explored the stores.

[–]10S_NE1 5 points 7 hours ago 
Exactly. There are lots of games you can download on your phone that don't require wifi. How about good old Candy Crush? There's a nice timesucker. I have to say, since I got my iPad, long flights seem pretty short since I always have something to do. You can also store interesting web pages offline for a few weeks and then read them.

[–]WombatBeans 4 points 7 hours ago 
You can also watch movies on your iPad offline, if they're downloaded to it. I do that before any long trip, find a few good standbys and download them in from the cloud (Harry Potter is a good option for me normally).

[–]drzowie 2 points 5 hours ago 
If you have seven hours to wait and can afford to fly places, you can afford to go into the nearest town and walk around a little bit. Figure you want to get back 2 hours before your flight, and it takes an hour to get into town and an hour to get back. That gives you three hours to have a drink, meet some locals, or look at the relevant "center" such as it is. It will generally cost you just a few bucks for whatever mass transit there may be.
I've personally done that with far shorter connections (down to about four hours) in London, New York, Puerto Rico, San Francisco, and Sydney. Totally worth it.

I travel a lot so this happens a lot. So: -
I tend to wander.
Have interesting chats with other passengers or staff at my gate, others, or stores (some gossip does rival telenovellas). I've kept in touch with some people I did this with many years ago and have even got some work out of it.
Do some parkour (security tend to go nuts now, but ahh those were the days)
Do Yoga/Pilates/body weight exercises with hopefully other people (I find if you can get 2-3 even for a short time others will join in - I've had the group so big sometimes that security have told us to stop, the knobs)
Play Hide 'N' Seek not just with kids. You have to keep your practise up because you never know when a game will kickoff in the real world.
If I have my guitar then jam or at least practise what I should have already known how to jam.
Find someone who is really afraid of flying and calm their brain by being weird, giving dad hugs, random conversations, or whatever.
Read a book.
Depending on the lounge facilities, get a massage or have a long shower.
If this is Dubai airport than go to the luxury car auction within duty free and bid in the regular raffles.
Find someone else who is bored and hot. Have sex.

Ha! I've spent 24 hours in an airport due to a storm. Thanks Northern Kentucky Cincinatti, Ohio airport for not having enough de-icer on December 23, 2004! Anyway, read a whole book. Then met a woman on my flight. We went to her apartment through 9" of snow yet to be cleared very well, where we tried to call airlines for hours. Then went back to the airport as we had booked a flight in six hours. Then met two other women between my age and ten years older and we drank wine and ate pizza for the final three hours until we heard "final boarding call for [the only flight to leave today to your destination]"! We threw down so much money that I'm certain we gave a 50% tip to our waitress. Then we hauled-A to the flight and made it. 4 hours on the plane later we finally took off!
TL;DR: read a whole book, then meet new friends. Went to one's house, we came back and met new friends and drink copious amounts of wine and ate pizza.
Edit: forgot the ] Edit 2: I know we left the airport. But we shouldn't have. That was around 3 hours or so of time. Remove that and it was still awesome haha

As a proud Singaporean, allow me to boast about my country's airport, the best in the world. The one and only, Singapore Changi Airport.
With 7 hours to spare: - if you are a nature lover, we have at least 3-47-8 themed gardens, including the cactus garden, sunflower garden, orchid garden and butterfly garden. There are also smaller gardens such as the piazza garden, the lily pad garden, fern garden, bamboo garden and enchanted garden. Oh and koi ponds in every other garden! - if you're more of a technological kind of guy, there are free to use internet stations everywhere, a movie theatre in every terminal, arcades, as well as entertainment centers where you can play game consoles, sing karaoke, jam with instruments and more. - if you are hungry or just feeling a little rich on the wallet, we have a whole shopping arcade full of branded goods stores, apparels, tech stores (you can buy your iPad here), food (from fine dining to quick bites) and not forgetting your souvenir shops. - if you prefer to wind down, there are massage chairs along the way, rest areas with special snooze chairs for you to take a quick nap, shower facilities, and a five star hotel right in the airport. - if you're into fitness and health, there's also a gym and a swimming pool for guests. - if you want to learn more about the heritage and culture of the country, there are special exhibitions all around the airport. If we go easy on the "you cannot leave the airport" rule, you can go on a free city tour that will bring you around our little country and take you on a sight seeing bus ride, even if you are still in transit and haven't/won't be going through customs.

I always bring at least one book. I have a kindle I refuse to associate with my amazon account, nor any wifi, due to them being assholes about how they handle DRM when traveling abroad. I have several dozen books on it that I could pick from based on my mood.
If I'm meant to not include that, I would read a regular book that I also brought, typically a pen and paper roleplaying book. They're usually 250-500 large, hardcover-bound pages.
With a full seven hours I would read the thing cover to cover, take notes and test scenarios / rules.

One time I was traveling to New York City but my home country fell to a rebellion and the government put in place wasn't recognized by the US government, so I wasn't able to leave the airport or go home. I started a romance with an airline attendant and even got a job under the table as a contractor for the company working on the airport.
Eventually the war was over but I had to accomplish what I came to the States to do and got an autograph from a famous jazz musician before finally going home.
I had plenty to do at the airport though. I remodeled an expansion at the airport, ate tons of fast food, befriended a lot of the airline workers (even helping one of them woo a member of homeland security), but the only thing was I had a tense relationship with the guy in charge of security. He was Stanley Tucci.

Most airports have some sort of "artistic" feature nowadays. Find it, and write a humorous article about how it is the dumbest thing ever created. If you are not naturally funny, this last one might take you all 7 hours.

Run up and down the moving side walk thing, try to do a handstand or a head stand, try to travel down the moving side walk by only holding on to the railing. Meet someone new, people watch with your new friend, have a drink. Read a book or a magazine. Hit on someone and try to take them on a date to the airport bar. Write a business plan for your dream job. write in your journal. Meditate. go on a walk. I can walk about 4 miles per hour for reference.

Well, shit. As someone from a small backwards ass town, the airport was half of the adventure.
Everyone is so interesting there! Thousands of people coming and going, stand in any line at any store and hear a conversation in almost any language. And the stores themselves! They go into overtime to try and sell any regional gifts, or tons of ethnic things to and draw those specific people. Or even just weird ass expensive shit that you'd only ever hear about online. I saw a perfume store and everything was hundreds of dollars!
Ever since then, I always thought it would he super interesting to work in one if I ever made it to a town of note. I'm sure so many of the people have wonderful stories to tell, and are eager to share! "It's my first time in America!" "We're going to Disney for the first time!" "I'm going back home to finally see my family!" Even if a good percentage of them will have traveler's fatigue and be really bitchy, I'm sure the interesting ones will outweigh them.
(I've also spent overnight in a major airport once. Shit was cash. I loved wandering around even when all was dark.)

I:
Slept 4 hours
Smoked 23 cigarettes
Drank 6 beers
Drank 2 coffees
Ate 2 paninis
Bought a Pringles and proceeded to spill all the content over the floor as soon as I sat down and opened it. Then I made a funny face and cursed while laughing, which made some people who were watching me laugh as well. 10/10 would repeat.
Shaved
Denied cigarettes to 25 different people
Gave 7 cigarettes
Talked to an old man with funny arab clothes from Saudi Arabia
Talked to a Italian girl
Talked to two italian guys
Talked to a French guy
Read all of the The Economist I had.

Truth is, airports are a good place to meet people. Lots of people are stuck alone with some time on their hands. And they are predisposed to be open and honest. There aren't usually long-term repercussions for anything that happens in an airport - especially for people who are not in their home city. So, people can be themselves. And so can you.
Or, and this is interesting, you can be anyone you want to be. In a situation like this, you are entirely free from...well, everything. I don't mean to imply that you can ignore the social contract, or that you can commit crimes etc. without repercussion - so don't be an asshole. But you can be unfettered in other ways. You are not limited by who you have been in the past, or by the reality of your circumstances. Relationships struck up in an airport are fleeting by nature, and a little social flexibility is unlikely to cause any harm.
Airport time leads to sex more often than you might think, too. For many people, it's a unique opportunity to act out without being burdened afterwards with social repercussion. It's a good place to not be afraid to ask. The answers you hear might surprise you. Plus, if you do misinterpret a situation and overstep comfortable boundaries, you can walk away pretty easily without doing any real harm. Just apologize for misreading and move on.

A lot depends on the airport. At some of the larger international airports, they have all kinds of things to do. Some now have a spa where you can get a pedicure or a massage; some have a massive shopping mall (Barcelona for example), and many in Canada actually have free wifi. For 7 hours, I might actually be tempted to purchase wifi if there was something on-line I really enjoyed that would make the time fly by. Just remember to get up and walk around a bit too if you've got a long flight coming up.

Buy a book! There's tons of books for sale in the airport and it's cheaper than getting drunk at a bar.

[–]hogie48 1 point 7 hours ago 
Walk around the terminal with your wifi searching until you find an open network
Buy whatever airline club pass is possible and hang out in their lounge. Normally that will give you WiFi
Buy a book / magazine(s)
Meet new people! If for some reason you are going to / coming from a conference, try and find people who attended the same event.
People watching can be fun, but I don't know about 7 hours of it...

Spend 50$ to go into a lounge and eat all the free food (Soup, crackers, salad, cookies, fruits) you can, charge your phone, take a shower, catch some z's.
It may seem expensive, but you're just not eating enough food. Also, soft drinks are usually free.
But, yea, 7hrs? Yea... I'll be in the damn lounge.

This all day. I fly quite a bit and long layovers suck. The ones that are a real bitch though are the ones where you get on the plane, they have trouble and keep you on it for hours. My last flight was a nightmare, was supposed to arrive him at 5pm instead arrived 3AM. On that note, fuck United.

If there are books available at the moment then I'll read a book.

This has literally happened to me. What I did was opened up my laptop and read a book that I had downloaded onto my laptop in order to do an assignment (before I left when I had wifi). I also played video games from steam (doesn't require the internet if they're already downloaded). If you're somewhere for 7 hours, maybe you should consider going out and visiting the city?

Just an FYI to travelers to Japan. If you land in Narita, there is no way in hell you are 'taking a taxi' into central Tokyo. That's, like, 300$. From Haneda you can... Still pretty expensive.
Narita has a program where they can give you a tour of the local Narita area for layovers of 4+ hours.
For 7 hours take a SkyLiner into Tokyo, as it's just 36 minutes from Narita, go down a few stops to Tokyo station and go out the Marunouchi exit and go see the imperial palace. There isn't much to really see or do there so just turn around and head back to the station.
Go on the Chuo line and head into Shinjuku. Go to the East gate and just walk around for a bit, eat some street vendor food. At this point I'd say it's been 3-4 hrs since you've left.
You can continue staying in Shinjuku for maybe a half hour more... or go down to Shibuya via the Yamanote line and go see Hachiko and go through Shibuya crossing.
Immediately get back on the Yamanote line and head to Ueno (from Shibuya) or to Nippori (from Shinjuku) and grab the next SkyLiner.
By the time you get back it'll be 6 hrs in and you should have enough time to clear immigration and security, again.

[–]jimmy_gd_fan 1 point 6 hours ago 
Explore the entire airport. Go through every terminal, shop, grab some food if you're hungry, see if there's any interesting lounges or views of the airport. If you're going to sit on a plane anyway, might as well get your moving done with.
Then when that gets old, pick your favorite restaurant out of all the ones you saw and eat there. Yes it'll be expensive, but so is flying so splurge a little. Try some fruity drinks you've never heard of, and then go find a comfy spot.
If you have a laptop, download some offline games beforehand. My favorites would be Portal 1 & 2, Prison Architect, Besiege, Roller Coaster Tycoon, and Sim City/Cities: Skylines (if your laptop can handle the last ones). Also maybe a few movies or seasons of a TV show. Other than that, I like to draw and write short stories, so bring paper and a few pencils. If you're into reading, you can do that, I'm not a fan though.

As someone to whom this happens way too often, I can't believe they don't put cinemas in airports, such an opportunity to price gouge poor desperate folk.
Only let in people whose flight is after 3+ hours or however long the movie is. Flights only ever get delayed, they never leave early so there's hardly a risk that someone's going to get distracted and miss it.

Happened to me in Munich during the volcanic eruption in Iceland a few years ago, so here's my answer;
1) Spend way too much money on Toblerone and Bitburger beer
2) wander aimlessly, but not too far because of security check points...
3) wander further and buy some meaningless thing from one of the shops because this is the third time you've been in it and people are eyeballing you...
4) Consider maybe going through security because, well, it'll break up the monotony...
5) return too late to grab a cot that the airport has laid out for its stranded passengers. Consider how un-fuckng-comfortable the couches in airports really are and default tot he much softer, much more forgiving floor.
6) try to nap. Give up. Proceed to Step 1.

Have a shower - Get creative with this. If done creatively an shamelessly you can freshen yourself completely. Dry off by using copious amounts of paper towels.
Treat yourself to a nice perfume from the duty free stores. Pick the most expensive one and apply liberally
Go to the book store and read magazines for free. Buy one if you can afford it.
Always travel with a lightweight jacket and a shawl. The shawl can be lain down to make a nice bedding. Don't even bother with the uncomfortable seating. Find a nice corner and settle down.
Go to a coffee shop and make that coffee last as much as your Harry potter.
Take up smoking and meet people in the smoking lounge
Try your luck at finagling yourself into the lounge. Very low chances but sometimes these things happen. Especially if your wait is because of Airline fuck ups. Get the airline into throwing in a lounge pass
Get some exercise - Use the stairs to run up and down. Stomach crunches will help your prepare for the next leg.
People watching - international airports have a lot of exotic people. bonus points for working yourself up into a fap. pro tip : use a bathroom.
Many airports have exhibits and mini museums in them.
Learn something - Load up your computer with offline courses. Learn how to touch type; spin up vimtutor and learn the fuck out of it.
Drink lots and lots of water. And then drink some more.

Happened to me in Japan. Had to get there late at night and hang out until the morning and everything was closed, no shops, no bars and just one food place that ran out of everything very quickly. The cool part about the airport is that you could get onto the roof, it was lit up and no one else was out there. So I did the only thing I could think of doing, I decided to do some martial arts. After a while I looked up and I had an audience of three security guards. It was pretty funny. I did some very showy forms before they came over to talk to me. I guess I was the most interesting thing going on. We also had a little earthquake and I did a lot of writing as well. The good part about being up all night and wearing myself out training, I slept for 90% of the 13 hour flight home, only waking up for food and when the plane suddenly dropped scaring the crap out of me.

My flight from spain was delayed 6 hours the other day without any wifi and I actually had a really good time since I've never minded waiting for longer periods of time. I had a bunch of beers with the vouchers I got, bought some nachos, read my book, listened to music, and got talking with a beautiful italian girl who hardly knew any english, so we had fun trying to communicate with eachother.
Those 6 hours were gone in an instant and the only downside was the time I landed at my destination. Wouldn't really mind doing it again.

People fishing. You toss change on the ground and wait for people to pick it up. The value of the coin determines the different "lures," so there's a cost--benefit system with using bigger lures in exchange for a better chance of someone picking it up. The fisherman who catches the most "fish" wins. Or you can play by yourself just for kicks.

I remember I had a layover in dulles and mine was 15 hours. Ended up getting a book of crosswords that I got from the gift shop. Spent about 3 hours doing that. About 8 trying to sleep in those shitty chairs. The other 3 were spent pacing around the airport. Oh and that final hour was eating and I helped the overnight janitor collect trash from the trash cans located everywhere. Big job since there were only 3 of them.
Always something to do.

This may blow your mind, but you can actually leave the airport. Just make sure your timepeice is on local time, and you leave yourself enough time to get back thru security. If you are in an airport that gets layovers on a regular basis, there will be something interesting nearby, and the means to get to it.
3 hrs in Dallas Ft Worth? Go to Grapevine, a town nearby with lots of wine tastings. There is a shuttle that runs from the airport to there, costs $5 USD.
6 hrs in Vienna? There is a high speed train to the city center for 20 euro, and lots of neat statues and a really amazing huge church.
7 hrs in Dusseldorf? Taxi to the old town for 25 euro, look around, get drunk and full at the Schwine haus, make it back with only 30 min to do security which is easy because security there has their shit together.

I use to get stuck at O'Hare airport a lot during my service years, and Id make a game of trying to have a drink in every bar in that airport. Its harder than you might think and it really helps kill the time. Eventually you really don't give a shit your stuck for so many hours. I never did ever make it to every bar, but I did enjoy the challenge!

I'd probably read for part of the time and play a handheld game for part of the time. However, since most of my books are ebooks I'm going to really hope that I remembered to charge my devices.
Was I anticipating this seven hour delay? If so I would be sure to bring a print book.

[–]poobahlette 1 point 6 hours ago 
It depends on the airport you are at and how much money you have. For example:
If Singapore: get your hair done, get a massage, or pay for a 30 minute shower. Sit in the free leg massage chairs and read a book. Then go to the bar.
If Sydney: Go to the outdoor bar deck, buy a book or a few magazines to read, drink beer.
If Dubai: Go sit in a sun chair, have a nap or read a book. Or purchase a few hours of their little bed booths. Or go upstairs and book a hotel room for 7 hours, buy a bottle of wine and watch TV.
If an American airport: If you have the money, go to a Best Buy vending machine and buy a tablet with wifi. All airports have wifi, some are free, others you purchase via boing boing. Then, go to a bar, get drunk and read reddit.

Drink booze, eat something unhealthy, take a nap, judge people for their outfits, wander around aimlessly, buy something stupid and cheap from a gift shop, read a book, shoot the shit with bored airport employees, shoot the shit with other bored fliers, jerk off in the bathroom, practice meditating and listen while parents try to keep their children away from the weird guy sitting in the middle of the floor.
I actually enjoy a good layover. When I am trapped in an airport I have nothing else to do and it can be pretty relaxing. Knowing that I can't change my situation, I can't do anything about any of my obligations, and my time there has an expiration date really chills me out. Usually I have my kindle on me with 100+ books on it which keeps me occupied for a couple hours then I go searching for fun. Depending on the size of the airport there is always shit to do. The best was Incheon; heated toilet seats, a huge mall to wander around, tons of attractive people to ogle, very little English speaking which made for some great background noise and I could go into one of the lounges to charge devices/take naps.

Simplest solution is to read book. But what I would normally do is watch the movies that I uploaded to my phone, try to beat my high scores on all of the games on my phone that don't require signal, and mix in some walking around the airport to the beat if some music from said phone. Or read one of the many books that I have also loaded on my phone. If I had planned ahead, surely I would have brought a couple of hand held systems and games to pass the time.

[–]Hollywood_Solberg 1 point 6 hours ago 
Head to the bar, have a few drinks then start looking for women. Look the airport is hands down, hands down the best place to hookup with women. Strange, attractive, charming guy you've never met before nor will you see again, spend an hour together wasting time then go back to your lives being whatever it is you are and back to whomever it is you're dating or married to, no one the wiser.

Pull out my Nintendo 3DS, put it in sleep mode, walk around until I hit 4,000 steps (gotta max them O-Powers in Pokemon!). Process all the streetpasses I got. Keep it in sleep mode while I charge it somewhere and read a book. Every hour or so, process all my new street passes.

Depends on the airport. If it's ATL, I'll walk around between all the terminals. Never miss out on the international terminals because the people watching is epic. Seattle has a nice open area between terminals that you can waste a lot of time in. Otherwise, I'll just read or do whatever work I can do offline. If I have my personal laptop, I'll play a Civ V game all the way through.

if so, go there and sit somewhere where you can see (off to the side) and watch people come through the gate to see their loved ones waiting for them.. its pretty uplifting.

Presumably I'd have brought things to entertain myself on the flight, so I'd probably knit, crochet, cross stitch, or pull out the Kindle (probably all of the above in 7 hours). If for some reason I didn't have any of that, I'd just go buy a book or two.

Well first, you take stock of what you DO have. I'd be set because I never travel without extra cash, a kindle full of books and dl'ed tv shows, and chargers. However, if my kindle was broken and my phone dead, and my chargers were unusable... id buy a book. Maybe make up back stories in my head for people walking by. Take a tour of all the bathrooms and rate them on cleanliness and how busy they are. Get a pen and paper and draw. Nap. I'd probably stoop to sitting in the common areas and eavesdrop on any loud converstions. Watch planes take off and try to guess which flight it is. Take off a shoelace and practice knots or use both for cats cradle. And depending on what airport you're in, there may be tv in a bar. Or find a moving sidewalk to walk the wrong way on... or walk the right way on and see how fast you can get from one side to the other. If Tom hanks character can live in a terminal for a year, I can find a way to deal for a few hours.
