[WP] Humans are actually the most violent, war-geared species in the galaxy. Another alien species has come to us with a request: "We need help killing these guys, they hate us and have oil. Here, have some technology and go nuts."WRITING PROMPT

After centuries of observation, there was only one inevitable conclusion that the galaxy's many cilivizations had been able to agree upon: humanity was far too dangerous and destructive to deserve faster-than-light technology. The Sentinels, in their report to the leaders of many worlds in the Galactic Council, made particular note of how humans in the Americas were treated once the other humans discovered those lands, and made a pretty obvious comparison to how their own planets would be treated. And that conquest was back when they were still using spears and guns; imagine what they could do with nuclear weapons! The humans would always want more.

The Merida were the first species to break the Pact. Some historians blame the fervent religious cult that had arisen around their chieftan, Hurlosk. Others blame the massive drought that plagued Merida's western hemisphere, making food from their off-world colonies even more important. They could not afford to lose any of their settlements to invading Eian. History could have even been influenced by that popular series of fictional adventure stories about Human warriors, who had achieved almost legendary status on most worlds. Whatever the reason, Hurlosk approached the humans and made them an offer. Reclaim the Merida colonies from the reptilian Eian, and they'd be rewarded with plunder and advanced technology beyond their wildest dreams. But even the Merida weren't foolish enough to offer the wormhole generators that would have allowed humans to travel between solar systems in an instant.

Humans were amazed by the sudden arrival of the extraterrestrials, and even more astounded by the offer. The nations of Earth had spent years and years trying to calm their own destructive impulses with treaties and disarmament to focus on more peaceful pursuits. And now it turns out that the way for humans to finally reach the stars was to embrace the inner warrior after all.

Funny, isn't it? That after millenia of trying to kill each other off to be King of the Hill, the one thing that actually managed to unite the humans was the chance to go to war with others? Sure, it wasn't immediate, but it didn't hurt. Chinese, Russian, American, and European armies all leaped at the chance to aquire some new alien technology, if only because they knew that their rivals would be getting it. They formed a cohesive fighting force, stronger together than they'd ever been separately. And after less than a generation, those petty difference that had seemed to massive were suddenly forgotten.

Hurlosk and the Merida were true to their word. They built massive warships designed for humans, but with no wormhole generators. The humans had been kept in the dark about this very crucial part of the plan: it was supposed to be a one way trip. Once those ships arrived at Eia and the war began in earnest, there would be no going back. At least, not for thousands and thousands of years at sub-light speeds. Hurlosk thought himself pretty shrewd for this twist, as did his brainwashed followers. The Eian would be defeted, and the humans would never be heard from again. Win-win. The Merida navy opened a wormhole between Sol and Eia, watched the warships vanish through, and returned to their own homes. Mission accomplished.

One single Eian ship arrived at Merida a matter of days later. It broadcast its message to the entire planet: "We're here to discuss surrender."

The entire planet feasted that night, knowing that they would soon be replenished by the colonies. Hurlosk's wild gambit had payed off better than anyone had ever dreamed! Even the most optimistic of experts expected fighting to rage on for at least half a Meridan year (which would be about two Earth years). Hurlosk accepted the message, again allowing the broadcast to be sent to every citizen worldwide. This was a great day, and he wanted to bask in his glory. None would dare challenge his leadership now.

"Very well," he told the sole Eian occupant of the ship. "What are your terms?"

The Eian licked his eyeballs, and Hurlosk was briefly confused. Wasn't this a sign of excitement in that culture? No matter. "Unconditional," the lizard answered.

"Very well." Hurlosk gave his most gracious bow, but couldn't contain the overjoyed wiggling of his antennae. "I accept your surrender."

The Eian ruffled his scales and gave a shiver, which is their equivalent of a laugh. "Oh, no, Hurlosk," the Eian told him. Hurlosk could see the many rows of teeth lining his jaw. "I am here to accept your surrender."

A hundred Merida ships blinked into existence, each from a separate wormhole. All of them bristled with the advanced weaponry that the Merida had designed for the humans.

"You gave them faster than light travel!" Hurlosk gasped at the Eian delegate. Unthinkable!

The Eian didn't seem even slightly bothered. "You would have seen us both destroyed," he answered.

"Tell me, Chieftan Hurlosk," a human voice broke into the transmission. "Are you familiar with the term 'counteroffer'?"

Thus ends the history of Hurlosk the Fool, and the beginning of the Empire of Man.

A collection of shorts would be killer.

I did, two months ago! You should pick up a copy.

And now that I think about it, one of the stories in the book is a lot like the one I wrote for this prompt, but with the opposite premise. The prompt was:

[WP] Surprisingly, it turns out humans are one of the least violent sentient species in the galaxy. Describe a session at the galactic equivalent of the UN.

I wrote this one on Reddit, and then a big continuation of it in the book that isn't published anywhere else.

It's kind of a dick move that they sent me alone.

Not complaining. Mr. Alien Overlord said they only needed one guy. Mr. President asked Mr. General to recommend a Mr. Best-Marine-In-The-Army. Mr. General recommended Mr. Myself here.

So they stuck Mr. Myself here on a rocket and shipped me off to the Andromeda Galaxy.

"Relax," Mr. Alien Overlord had said, "It'll be fine."

They gave me a small device like an iPod with a single button for a display and said, "That is our technology. You don’t press the button until you watch the instructional video."

"Where's the instructional video?"

"We'll send it to you when it’s time."

Yeah. Ok. Of course I'll do it. Racist aliens that want to eliminate every other species in the galaxy? Yeah, I'll help you fight them. Yeah, I trust that this box with a button will help me defeat a planet. Yeah, you got it under control.

But now I'm getting closer to the planet. And no instructions. Nothing.

Dick move. For real.

I check through the windshield outside – the planet is red, and it's growing closer.

What do I do if I get there and there's no instructions? Ask for directions? Tell them I'm lost? Join them and become an intergalactic racist so I don't die?

I pull the button-device from my pocket and study it. I've contemplated pressing the damn thing like a hundred times in the week it took for me to get here.

But they told me to wait. They told me to wait, so I'm waiting. The dicks.

"Identify yourself," comes a voice through my speakers.

Shit.

I look down at the button again.

"Identify yourself now or we will open fire."

They see me. No more time. Crap.

I hover my hand over the button.

I hear the Overlord Alien's voice, back at the meeting on Earth: "It is essential that you wait for instructions before pressing the button."

"This is your last warning. Identify yourself or we will –"

The voice dies away in a hiss, like a radio switching between stations. I look up and my windshield is taken over by the Alien Overlord's face.

"Hello, Mr. Austin," the video starts. "Thank you for waiting for the instructions before pressing the button."

"How did you know I didn't press the –"

"A quick overview, before we talk more about the device you carry with you – our species has recently found out that the universe we all live in is – in fact – a simulation."

"What?" I ask, like the video can hear me.

"After some debating, we decided that this didn't really matter, since we had no way of getting out of the simulation. So we carried on with our lives."

"Well, that does make sense…"

"Like all simulations, however… Universe has some… glitches. Bugs you can exploit, if you get access to the source code."

I look down at the button again.

"That is all you need to know. Please use the device in your possession with responsibility, and return it to us once you've finished your mission. Best of luck and… have fun."

The Overlord disappears, and my windshield goes back to reflecting the red planet, where a bunch of black ships are now hovering in front of it, their laser guns pointed my way.

"Ready to open fire!" comes the voice again.

The button looks up at me, and I look down at it.

"Fuck it," I say, pressing down on it.

A screen rises from the device like a hologram, flashing in blue. A menu.

CHEATS

INFINITE LIFE

INFINITE AMMO

EXPLOSIVE BULLETS

GIANTS HEADS

ALL WEAPONS

SUMMON MR. MEESEEKS

ARMOR UP

LIFE UP

In slow motion, I look from the menu to the windshield, where more and more ships gather around me.

"Open fire!" comes the voice, and the laser guns shift my way.

"Oh, this is going to be fun," I say, feeling a smile creeping into my face as I press the first option on the menu.

We went to them for help at 34D8892.992; their date was Sunday, the 7th day of the 9th "month" of 12, September, in their year 2025.

We were desperate, and with some convincing, they were willing to help. Primitive though they were, practically every member of their species was a well-engineered killing machine, their grasping hands more than capable of ripping tentacles or even plunging, hammer-like, through normal life's carapaces. The visual surveillance had informed us they were intelligent enough to be reasoned with, and strong enough to fight our war for us.

We gave them gate technology, and our most fearsome blade thrower technology, capable of launching dozens of sharpened blades nearly half of one of their "kilometres". We offered them the natural resources and spoils of our enemy, all their precious metals and oil, and promised them riches.

When they first opened the gate to our enemy, they chose their homeworld. We were terrified, did they not know the gate would work both ways? The enemy swarmed through in numbers too large to count, before it started.

A continuous roll of barking thunder, unnatural and painful, roared through the air, as their soldiers casually crouched. The shortspears they held ripped the air itself open with fire, and the enemy fell. The soldiers relaxed, their fire spears slowing and wandering, and yet still the enemy fell. I heard the retreat called, and knew the battle was over, but still the spears barked, and the enemy, now fleeing, fell.

I saw the soldiers walk up to the gate, waving their spears to and fro, still spitting fire, when a series of immense birds swooped through the gate. Ashen-coloured and screaming like demons, they opened their wings only on the other side, and soared upwards. The birds continued to fly through for another minute, and then silence reigned for tense minutes. The soldiers stayed on guard with their terrible weapons raised.

Their chief soldier conferred with his underlings, and one of the soldiers pointed to the specially-crafted eye covers my team had been given as a gift. He put on a set of similar-looking devices, and I motioned for my team to do the same as a mark of respect. The chief solder called out "EYES!"

It was in the seconds after that I realised our mistake. These were not intelligent beings with unseemly brutish abilities. They were agents of Negliesh, the eighteen-tentacled crawling mountain of despair, the crown lord of death and obliteration. They could bring only destruction.

The light from their weapons seared at my carapace, even through the gate. They burned like a dozen distant suns brought to the ground. Our enemy's stronghold, their capital city, and the island it was borne on were all brought to dust through fire.

The humans, perhaps I thought sensing our discomfort, turned off the gate, for there was no-one left to hold it open on the other side.

The Chief's first words to me as the gate reopened to my homeworld caused my fluid exchange bags to spill. "Who else do you know that possesses gate technology?"

Just another day in the army. 700,000 of the most highly trained and equipped soldiers human kind had produced, looking at each other over a wall in Europe.
SSKraw looked at the high overlord of the Waiftons knowing the wrong words could bring his death "Your Highness, star system 9d34 through 9c58 have fallen to the Cathians"
"I know the planets we have lost" the Overlord hissed "how are we going to stop the losses"?
"We have found a species in the outer rim, calling themselves Humans, the most violent ever found" SSKraw groveled "we can use their soldiers to help our cause"
The Overlord looked suspiciously at SSKraw "We don't have time to train the divisions needed to stem the tide of battle on Sigma Alpha, how could they help?"
SSKraw turned on the holosphere showing WWII and Vietnam War footage. "they are exceptionally brutal warriors, making personal combat weapons rivaling our own with much inferior technology" SSKraw soothed "two major powers have fought each other to a standstill and have a 20 full divisions that could be shipped out in short order"
"That's a million warriors" the Overlord snapped "don't be ridiculous, even the Xarian Councils don't have access to that number of troops, the societal costs of keeping armies that large would be staggering"
"On my life sir" SSKraw said solemnly "These humans have 10 times that number of Soldiers"
The overlord wathed the war footage and felt a spark of hope "and how could we afford these brutal soldiers, they must want a high price"
"They seem to accept energy units and shiny metals for payments" SSKraw said triumphantly "we will turn the battle tide"
"you will go there and get me troops" The overlord commanded First contact happened in China, and much to China's chagrin, the US forcefully took over negotiations and the world learned of US space weapons.
The first expeditionary Marines hit the ground on Sigma Alpha and surveyed the situation, poorly outfitted waiftons, struggled to defend the population centers from the Caithons. Very little actual fighting occurred. If a large enough group surrounded the Waifton soldiers they would surrender. They seemed to do on the ground "conceptual fighting", running computer simulations deciding who would win.
General Herman looked at his second in command "lets get some tanks and artillery in here"
Six days later the Caithons surrendered there forces on Sigma Alpha. With every ship back and forth from earth more Alien tech was smuggled back to earth, the liberation of the galaxy was going to start very soon.

The aliens landed on George's ranch, he was ready. He'd read his email, he knew they were coming, now he only waited to hear what they had to say. In broken English, the tallest one uttered,

"Have oil...need... Democracy-"

"Say no more," George interrupted, "I'll get my good friend Rommel on the phone and see what he can do."

Within two weeks, Blackwater's finest men were geared up in full Spartan suits, modeled from the Alien's culture examination files, and were ready to be shipped off to the Sector 3, to a desert planet rich with all the materials star captain Donald Trump could have ever wanted.

He would be a hero, he would make America great again.

"I'm glad that you agreed to meet with me after my demonstration this morning, and the time spent waiting was most instrumental in updating my translation software. This Google that you have, the pronunciation of words in its translate software was most useful.

"You, humans, are the most violent species that hasn't already been coopted into the Damlish Empire. We need help killing them, or they will absorb us and absorb our knowledge of you. We've studied you for the past 200 of your years and your ascension has been fascinating although I must say that the research has generally been on hold since what you call the Roswell incident and the deaths of the chief researchers. However, I reopened the files and you appear to be a great leader amongst the humans.

“You want us to do what?”

The President was a little flustered. He could never have expected Aliens to be...friendly.

The aqua-green jelly blob at the other side of the table spoke.

“Destroy them for us. You can, right?”

The president matted his hair with his hand.

“I am one of the world's best negotiators. I think we can make a deal”

The big squishy thing made an expression that I would think was a grin if you didn't know better.

“Of Course, we want you to clean up your own planet!”

“Are you saying we should build a wall?”

“I’m saying you should make Earth great!”

The president was grinning.

“Of course We Will! we will hunt, every, single one of them!”

The Extraterrestial’s ambassador finally added, like a cherry on an icecream sunday.

“Oh, and did I mention, President Trump, that they have oil?”

Actually it starts with "A hymn before battle"

Agreed though, good series.

I love this one, like the last starfighter in a more "it's good to be bad" angle.

I'd love to watch this in a feature film. Then again it's essentially be Halo or Call of Duty "the movie".

A two hundred and twentieth of the average universal lifespan?

He had felt pity the first time he had heard it.

Their oldest members had by his species standards died barely out of infancy, made frail as they had lived far beyond their own species natural lifespan.

It was almost too much to comprehend, when one of his species died it was rare enough to shock that he had trouble relating to the species that lived to only a couple of thousands of years.

The humans died in such high numbers and such a variety of ways that it terrified and confused, how could they function without a constant state of panic?

they have so little to lose, that's why they're dangerous

They had something called "gallows humor" where they made light of their short lives, typically employed when they were close to doing something that would end it even sooner.

The term itself was made from a practice of killing to punish by restricting air supply. No longer used, but they had used it.

Their information sharing system was impressive, less efficient than their home planets but worth studying to refine their own techniques.

While doing so they had discovered so much.

History detailing acts that could barely be read without overwhelming fear taking hold, science that filled in some gaps of universal knowledge with some bits and pieces that confused.

Various substances and forces seemed to behave differently than universally understood on that planet, perhaps that's why they lived so briefly?

We need their help, maybe we can help them once they've saved us

The single rebel world in an aligned galaxy of pacifists was in an enviable position.

Even the worlds that would resort to violence to defend themselves had forgotten how, too inept to defend themselves from an army that had spent the better part of a century re-learning how to fight.

They only wanted to inflict misery and pain on the galaxy and had mostly gone unchallenged in doing so.

Humans on the other hand had fought for many reasons, some as evil as theirs. But the biggest cause of all was for resources.

Their needs were quite modest when compared with the rest of the galaxy, but they had less than they needed throughout history.

they can have all the resources they'll ever need

The humans could eradicate their oppressors with an ease and efficiency that would leave no room for error, they had found a way to utilize energy sources for explosions as a means to destroy their opponents.

They had enough to destroy the entire rebel planet.

If their reading of the humans was right they wouldn't need much in return, but they were prepared to offer an abundance of everything they considered valuable. Knowledge of how to create food, materials to build, climate control.

The issues facing their species were nothing new, they had all been solved and all could be solved for this one favor.

Flippancy would probably work better than a more diplomatic approach with this species if the majority of their internet was to be believed. Maybe a minor incentive to help he sent a message through their entire internet system, everybody connected would see and could respond to inquire about the details.

"We need help killing these guys, they hate us and have oil. Here, have some technology and go nuts."

He had sent that the previous hour with no response. Perhaps they thought he was "trolling?".

Trying again he sent a more formal greeting....

technology given to us is outdated and is similar to our own tech of the 1960s. We help the aliens kill their oil-rich enemies' army then set up a "democracy." Flashforward to 2150, we realize the oil-rich enemies have an ideology much more like our own and decide to kill the original aliens that contacted us in the first place. Both alien civilizations find our hypocrisy dishonorable and annoying and team up to kill us, and they do. the end. of humans.
