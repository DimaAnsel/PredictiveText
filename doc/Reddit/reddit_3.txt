I live in New Brunswick, and when I was a child I had a Sikh friend. His father was involved in real estate. They moved to Montreal, he got into some shady dealings, and he was killed by the mob on his front door step. It was all over the papers at the time, this was about 88-89. Last name was Barar.
edit my mother has corrected me, it was Brar, not Barar. That's how it was pronounced. Can't find any articles online with a brief search, but it was decades ago now.

There are mafia families all over the world. The mob never died, they just got a lot more intelligent and a lot more embedded in other organizations, like Government. See the JFK connections, the CIA/Mafia connections, etc.
They let the media think the mob died with Gotti, and the media did their due diligence by reporting it just so back in 2002.

So I hate to be this guy, but it seems like you think the best word describing the phrase used to grasp attention and display emotion is "ejaculation" when its actually "interjection". Most people see "ejaculation" and think of the bodily function. I know I would want someone to tell me,

[–]flickering_truth [score hidden] 42 minutes ago 
Actually I believe ejaculation is being used correctly in this instance. 'Come on!' is an example of an involuntary sudden verbal expression. Another example would be 'wow what!'. An interjection is when you interrupt someone's sentence with your own comment, usuually to disagree or clarify an error on the part of the speaker.

I don't know anything about Italian-American mafia, but I know quite a lot about Italian mafia. You can't grow up in Sicily in the 80s and 90s without getting a deep understanding of what the mafia is, unfortunately. I think many here don't realize that ndrangheta (the mafia from Calabria) is quite different from the Sicilian mafia. The Sicilians lost most of their power and all the bosses are now in jail. The ndrangheta managed to get a huge chunk of their former power and then some. They now control a considerable part of the traffic of cocaine in the West. Compared to the Sicilian mafia they are more business-like and much harder to fight (their organization is more based on actual families of relatives compared to the Sicilian "families", and thus harder to infiltrate)

[–]noselfdoxman [score hidden] 1 hour ago 
Which West? Like the Italian West or the West as in Europe and stuff?

They are a really resourceful and tough organization, and you are quite right in saying that they managed to keep their operation low key and to resist infiltration because they are much more selective in their recruitment policies. They are built on a fluid conglomerate of independent cells, much like terrorist groups, based on kinship. This ensures loyalty to a high degree, so much so that there have been very few ndrangheta informants (maybe ten or twelve) while there are literally dozens of mafia pentiti. An investigation made by our parliament likened them to a crime franchise, able to reproduce itself all over the world with the same, elementary structure and methods.
They are all over the world: Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and, incredibly, they have a strong presence in South America; they cooperate with narcos cartels to move drugs to Europe, Australia and North America. They launder drug money in tens of countries; they are in the hazardous waste business (they simply scuttle ships full of chemical plant waste and even radioactive materials while keeping the recycling money); they have ties with every single criminal organization out there, including the fucking Zetas in Mexico and the Hell's Angels in Canada. They are pretty scary.

Can confirm. Sonia Maino Gandhi is arguably the most powerful person in Indian politics, and India has perpetually been embroiled in scandals with Italians ever since she married into Indian "royalty". Starting with the Bofors Scandal involving her husband, down to the the recent Choppergate. It may not involve Godfather-like figures, but the figures involved can certainly be traced to the Italian underworld.

Your comment begs the question: Why is your one comment, from a throw away, about Sonia Gandhi?

That's a good question:
This is not a throwaway.
I hate what her party has done to the country, so you're free to call me biased. I admit it outright right now.
It's about Sonia Gandhi because I was replying to a comment on the Italian Mafia. From what we see in India, the Italian Mafia is much like Lord of War that only cares about profits.
So there, you've exposed my biases.

What can be annoying is that the Mafia owns all the construction and development companies in Toronto. So even when all the streets are updated and new, streets will be torn up for no reason causing major delays (mostly for months at a time) just so the Mafia can make more money and extend their contracts with the city.

Yeah... Resident of NS and NL here, literally everybody in both the places I live was super hyped for Trudeau. But then, it was more that the vast majority of people I've gone to school with and spoken to hated Harper with a passion, and were voting for whoever was more likely to get him out of office. Even Newfoundland, which socially is pretty darn Conservative, hates Harper and everything he stood for.
I still don't get the love for Harper and the Conservatives out west though, like, is it literally if someone blows Oil execs hard enough and lowers taxes enough, they get everyone's vote out there? Harper severely muzzled the scientific community, Bill C51 and C24 were huge backwards steps for citizens' rights, he defanged the investigative wing of Elections Canada, he bought hard into the scam that was the F35 program, and did his damnedest to stall and stop the NSPS which is huge for the Navy, since we're technically a 6th-rate Navy at this point... Not to mention the robocalling scandal that happened during the last election, plus the whole Mike Duffy scandal, and he backpedaled on reform of the Canadian Senate. That's just what I can think of off the top of my head here, I'm sure someone out there has a well-sourced list of Harper failures and stagnation throughout his terms as PM.
Like, seriously guys? I'll be the first to admit I'm pretty left-wing, but if your party has repeated scandals and constantly fails to deliver on promises made during elections, I think it's time to reconsider your blind loyalty to your party. Hell, if the Liberals and NDP had scandals ongoing in their ranks at the same time, I'd at least vote Communist.

I was there that night. It's scary to think how many people could have gotten hurt if the gun fire was in the opposite direction 38 casings were found at least that's what the officers told me the day after.

Would you mind elaborating on that a bit for us? This is a rather interesting topic and you have an insight most of us don't.

Easy he doesn't know a lot. He knows as much as he reads because that's all the street shit that actually leaks. I lived in Woodbridge as well and am of Italian descent. The hear say some kid hears in reddit (including myself) is all fluff. He has no real insight and probably won't reply to your post. Don't hold your breath.

Are you that surprised? There has been a few incidents over the past few years that I wasn't entirely shocked at this news.
Think about the shooting up in Woodbridge, the dude who was murdered in Little Italy watching the Euros a few years back. I just hope it stays out of Corso Italia,

Vancouver has tons of organized crime related violence although I don't think it's too much Italian mafia - more Asian triads and southeast asian gangsters and bikers.

My dad used to live in Toronto in the late 70s. One of the coolest stories he ever told me was how he witnessed a gang war between the Italians and an Asian gang. Guys literally fighting in the streets with knives and guns.

Anyone interested in this should keep an eye on Marco Muzzo. This guy was recently involved in a drunk driving accident where he killed a grandfather and three children in an accident so gruesome that 5 of 8 paramedics took 2 weeks leave due to PTSD.
So far he has already hired Brian Greenspan as his lawyer, and managed to have his trial pushed back twice. It is likely that this will get swept under the rug due to his influence.
